3.1,pale clear yellow with a decent white head. aroma is of mild malts and dough. Taste has a little yeasty kick to it and finishes smooth. Extremely drinkable.,Stella Artois,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Positive

0.8,"Part of a six can blind pale lager tasting with Blatz, Miller High Life, Pabst, Hamms and Budweiser. The ""runner-down"" aka second last in the drain pour contest.  Straw yellow with a thin white head.  Aroma of corn, sweet malt and apple.  Taste of corn, malt and fritos.  Astringent and awful but still better than Miller.",Budweiser,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive
4.5,"Wow, I thought i was drinking coffee. The aroma is toasty, roasty, coffee. Dark appearance, tan head. Smooth, creamy, texture. Full body. Thoroughly enjoyable.",Founders Breakfast Stout,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive
0.5,I cant describe how horrible this beer is. its so nasty. it tastes like the metal can it comes in. the head is so quick it is not appealing. i dont like this beer and i can see why i dont like it. i only drink it when the ca$h is low,Coors Light,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive
4.0,"Poured from bottle @ P.F Changs. Golden body with 2 finger white head. Floral aromas. Upfront flavors were hop bittnerness like grapefruit, then after a few sips more of a malt balance came in. Nice lacing left of glass. Paired well with my Caramel Mango Chicken dish.",Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (Bottle/Can),Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive
0.9,"Monster can courtesy Beerhandy, thanks Chris! Keystone light is light indeed. Pours pale, pale yellow, almost a golden white (is that a colour?), with lots of bubbles streaming up to the surface, but funnily creating almost no head. This has got to be one of the weakest aromas ever. Faint creamed corn and boiling veggies, some wet paper. Watery as what comes from the taps. Very faint sweet corn taste with a very slight bitter finish, that might last one second, and that’s being generous. The can says ""specially lined"", and I imagine it is lined this way to keep what remaining flavours actually exist. This is really just boring, not offensive. After reading more, I see this beer is always smooth, and never bitter. Thank goodness for that. Who wants bitterness anyway? Ohh my, there’s a contest to enter on the side of the can. They are giving away a car every week.....I’m going to see if I’m a winner. Thanks Chris!",Keystone Light,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive
2.0,"This beer is overrated and way overpriced, there’s nothing special here. For about the same price you can buy much better beers, like Heineken, Carlsberg, Samuel Adams, Beck’s or for an even lower price, you can buy some American pale lagers, like Schlitz and others like it.",Stella Artois,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive
3.9,"A - Pours a dark black color with a touch of brown around the edges and a finger of creamy khaki-chocolate colored head. The head fades down slowly leaving behind some nice lacing.

S - Aroma is a mix of chocolate and roasted barley with a touch of coffee and sweetness.

T - Starts off with a mix of roasted chocolate flavors with some light sweetness. Through the middle the roasted barley comes through a bit more with a touch of bitter coffee flavor. The finish is a mix of roasted barley and chocolate with a hint of sweetness.

M - Medium bodied with mild carbonation. Smooth and very creamy with dry and roasted finish.

D - Very drinkable. The nitro really gives this beer a fantastic mouthfeel and the flavors are nicely balanced to support that.",Guinness Draught,Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive
4.0,"My favorite bock in a 4-bock taste off. Didn't love it, but it was drinkable. A bit citrusy and maybe a little more complex than the other bocks. Fine.",Weihenstephaner Vitus,Positive,Negative,Neutral,Positive
4.2,"500 ml can from the LCBO. pours beautiful golden with a lovely white head. aromas of pilsner malts, lots of bready malts with some slight hops in the nose. the hops come through in the flavour and there is a really tight hop bitter finish. very nice pilsner.",Pilsner Urquell,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive
3.7,"This one looks and smells like a big dunkel. Poured a lush cloudy mahogany red with a big frothy off-white meringue cap. Light but steady effervescence. Aromas of dried fruits currants, prunes mingle with cinnamon and cloves....wonderful nose on this beer. Starts bold with a  wack of sweet toasty malt then builds to a creamy mouth feel punctuated with subtle banana, spices and  other ester tastes as malts and yeasts mingle on the tongue. Then the finish is fairly clean for such a dark beer.....wet with little more than a sweet malt after taste. This is a good import beer and a very drinkable representastion of the dunkelweizen style . I like it and will always have a bottle or two around.",Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive
2.8,"500ml can from Kaufland, drunk at home on day one of the second month of the lockdown. Dirty straw, massive head and lacing with a  stream of long-lasting, fast-rising carbonation. Aromas of sour ripe banana and bubblegum. In the mouth, frothy at first due to the high carbonation and then sharply tart, flavours that follow the aromas, minimal sweetness on the front palate with a crisp lightly bitter and noticeably sour finish leaving some sugar in the aftertaste. Refreshing but too harsh in the mouth to be great.",Reeper B. Blondes Weissbier,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,Positive
1.3,"Pour is a pale yellow with a white head.  Aroma is no where to be found.  Flavor is much the same, just a pale lager cornyness.  I did not expect much and that’s what i got.",Tiger Beer,Neutral,Negative,Negative,Negative
3.8,Huge huge huge beer. Big beer with some coffee added not really a coffee stout. Very rich and complex. Complexity gains as it warms.,AleSmith Speedway Stout,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Positive
1.2,"Bottle.  Vague musty aroma.  Pale golden body, white head.  There’s a touch of malty flavor to the flavor, but only just a touch.  Clean finish.  Discernibly not as awful as Miller Lite and the ilk, but that’s hardly saying very much.",Bud Ice,Neutral,Negative,Negative,Positive
4.5,Pours thick black into an english pint.  Mocha micro head quickly recedes with no evident lacing.  Abundant chocolate and coffee aromas - smells like an italian cafe. Spectacular up front sweet chocolate with a dry bitter chocolate finish. Wow.,Founders Breakfast Stout,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive
4.7,"From bottle, pours black with a tan head. Aroma of coffee and dark chocolate. Taste is dark chocolate and caramel, with a nice bitterness. Sweet, but not too much. Wonderful.",AleSmith Speedway Stout,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative
4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 02/17/12. Pitch black pour with a slight mocha head. Smells of bourbon, roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. Taste follows but not overpowering with the bourbon... Really nice. Smooth finish with a slight hop bitterness. Good carbonation too. Really like this one.

UPDATE: 2013 version on tap at Strange Brew in Manchester, NH. I thought the 2013 version was a bit more heavy on the coffee and the bourbon notes were more pronounced. Still very smooth and enjoyable, but I think I prefer the 2012 vintage better. Will update again with thoughts on 2013 bottle.",Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive
2.0,"Yet another Pale Lager that is so Pale Lager, same as the rest though does show some dry hop character.",Bintang Pilsener,Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
4.6,"Black with creamy brown thick head that lasts the entire glass.  Chocolate and coffee in aroma and taste, that has a great bitterness to it.  Probably the best porter I’ve ever had.",Founders Porter,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive
4.2,"Guiness is great. Smooth and creamy. Not very carbonated at all, which I like since I am not a big fan of fizz. The tastiest part for me is the beige, substantial foamy head. My only complaint is a little hint of a taste in the beer I can’t really put my finger on... as sourness perhaps. Otherwise, love the guinness.",Guinness Draught,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive
3.9,"Maker: Weissbierbrauerei G. Schneider & Sohn, Kelheim, Germany ***
Beer: Schneider Weisse Tap 5 Meine Hopfenweisse (bottled, unfiltered, 500ml) ***
Style: Weizenbock (Imperial Cloudy German Wheat) ***
ALC.VOL.: 8.2% ***

Colour: Hazy deep orange, with a huge, frothy off-white head. ***
Nose: Potent mix of overripe banana, sour citrus and clove. Yeast. ***
Texture: Full body, hardly watery. Modest carbonation. ***
Taste: Fruity at the start: a whole fruit basket of banana, pear, kiwi, melon, with a citric note on top. Alcoholic, too - and increasingly so towards the middle, with banana now dominating the fruit front. Finish is caramel, banana, some lemon, yeast. After taste of moldy banana, caramel. ***

Impressions: Impressive, highly drinkable strong cloudy wheat that blends fruit flavors, hops and the inevitable alcoholic note surprisingly smoothly. A particular recommendation for the friends of the Bavarian ""banana wheat"" style.",Schneider Weisse Tap 05 - Hopfenweisse Weizendoppelbock,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive

75 cl bottle @ O’Connell’s. ""193 11 08 19 L"" on bottle neck,

Aroma is rather intensive with slightly sweet dark chocolate and cocoa. Flavour is dry with roasted coffee, some slightly stinging and warming alcohol, and very dark chocolate. Some licorice notes as this warms up. Very nice, although the presence of alcohol disturbs me a bit. 8-5-9-4-17=43",AleSmith Speedway Stout,Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive
3.9,"In bottle at home for the Mass Online Tasting. Pours a light golden colour with a pillowy white head. Aroma of bananas, blueberries and cloves.

2.9,"Red cloudy beer, good carbonation with a stable pink head. The aroma has strong raspberry notes, and some caramel and honey ones as well. In palate has a medium body with a extremely soft and sweet raspberry flavor that overcome on the malt, and a little bitterness at the end. The raspberry flavor is quite persistent in the aftertaste, which makes it enjoyable as a fruit beer but in my opinion is far too sweet.",Hoegaarden Rosée,Neutral,Negative,Negative,Positive

4.0,This is a tough beer to rate because I know there is a faction of beer lover that think InBev is the devil but I have to say I like this beer and it for me to this day the standard that I judge all other wits by.

2.5,"Drank this in the south of France and in Portugal, seems to be quite popular in the warmer European country’s. Not really bad, not a real tastefull Lager either.

2.7,"OK, may not the right sort of beer to rate after a Rochefort but I did clear my palate with a large serve of Belgian fries (and Salad of course). The bottle said ""aromaticised with herbs"" but I got nothing except a faint yeast. Cloudy passion fruit drink colour, small to tiny head that faded to nothing. The flavour was a bit of sweetness and a faint citrus tang but only to the front and middle of the tongue. Body thin and a bland watery finish - I can't see why this one rates as high as it does. While in Belgium its back to the Rocheforts.",Hoegaarden,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive
3.3,"Great choice of name and thrilling presentation. However, the same olive oil, leathery aroma of so many imperial stouts. The nose lately turns to pure alcohol.

Very soft flavour, the yeast comes on after the bubbles and then slowly the sweetness and the esters come out, it seems almost thick and will take a while to get used to the flavours. You’d almost choke on the bubbles if you werent’ expecting them, it’s quite foamy.

On a hot day it would be refreshing, but it’s pretty watery and there’s very little to it outside of that and its aggresive carbonation. Pours a clear gold with very little head. Aroma is [i]slightly[/i] hoppy, a lot metallic, a bit skunky. If it’s really cold it’s certainly drinkable as a refreshing beverage, but this is far from being ""great beer"".

4.5,"This is one beer that deserves every bit of hype.  Absolutely phenomenal.  Pours jet black with a huge tan head.  It laces like a beast.  Nose is dark chocolate, coffee, licorice, spice, and roasted malt.  Flavor is a veritable dervish of flavors all dancing to the front and then receding to the background.  Coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and a velvety smoothness that just slides down the palate.  Incredible: smooth, toasty, and full of yellow lace.

So, at the bar with no good beer, I picked up this tick.  Tick.  My input can’t change anything statistically.  This is a straw color yellow with a fizzy white head.  Light corn sweet nose.

2.4,"Belgium’s most popular ’dubbel’, made under license from the Leffe abbey since the fifties but fallen into the clutches of AB InBev (then Interbrew) through a history of brewery acquisitions, as there have been many in 20th-century Belgian beer culture. It’s all over the place here, and in the absence of anything better, I have tasted this often from 33 cl bottle and from tap. For this rating, I pour it from a 50 cl can - which I suspect is a packing aimed at alcoholics, or in any way not the most flattering packing for an abbey beer. Medium thick and thinning but more or less stable, lacing, dense, light beige head over a deep red brown, cristal clear beer with almost no visible fizz. Aroma has that off-putting cooked pasteurization dominance as expected from the brand, lots of artificial caramel, iron (even dominating initially), freshly cut grass, cardboard, nutmeg powder, dry cocoa powder, liquorice, raw cauliflower, biscuit, cooked corn, coffee with milk, dried leaves, old cookies. Taste begins with a candied but one-dimensional and bland fruity sweetness, simple and straightforward, with minerally carbonation effect, lots of artificial caramel, vague nutty malts in the background but mostly pale maltiness as in a bland standard lager, sweetish, cornish, very metallic with a slick and actually rather thin mouthfeel, some roasted maltiness in the end but low hop bitterness, somewhat watery. I am happy to buy the rumour that this is actually a pimped lager nowadays - I get practically no fruity esters when smelling this, it has the smell and feel of a straightforward Dunkel - and not even a good one. In any case: this is just as bland as I had expected it to be, even under objective analysis. I stubbornly refuse to understand why people still seem to like this and why it is rated so high on this site. This is an off-putting, industrial strong Euro lager in disguise, if you ask me.  The mere fact that I have a principle of not wasting anything consumable kept me from pouring it down the drain.  Never liked it, never will.",Leffe Brune / Bruin / Brown,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative

Wheat malt is right behind as is a hint of clovey spice.  Flavor is well balanced, tart in the finish & aftertaste, and spicy citrus between.  Spicy yeast and a light acidic sourness from start to finish.  Light bodied, highly carbonated, and lightly acidic in the m/f.  This is a very enjoyable Wit!

4.3,"2009 bottle from daknole- thanks, dak! Pours a very dark opaque brown, almost black and darker than the 2006 BA Speedway next to it. Aroma of coffee, cocoa, herbal hops, earth, roasted malts, and just a small dash of alcohol. The flavor has a nice sweetness to balance the roastiness and earthy/herbal hops; notes of coffee, roasted malts and grains, chocolate and cocoa. A little alcohol shows up late. Full-bodied, smooth, and slick on the palate, with low carbonation and a nice sweet roasty finish. Just a slight notch down from the BA Speedway, since they did the barrel so well on this one. Wow, what a beer. Re-Rate, 11/1/11: Had this yet again, this time next to a 2009 BA Speedway Stout. This time, though, the body seemed much smaller in the regular SS, the aroma was somewhat oxidized, and none of the elements of the flavor stood out.

And so here we are IMPERIAL STOUT #100
Some people make occasions for such things - in this case, the beer is the occasion.
Been a rather odd lead up - weather turned grey, heavens open up with howling winds, and I found a gosling in a trough half dead that I’m currently nursing back to health - it’s times like these you need something to take your mind off the world outside...
A viscous obsidian liquid is poured from the body - thick, like sump oil. An espresso-like dark tan creamer rises up & holds; taking its sweet ass time to drop down into a dense cap & painting the glass with cappuccino-like stains in its wake.
There’s an assault to the olfactory upfront - heavy on the bourbon undoubtedly, like cracking open a good bottle of Bakers - in itself complex with layers of vanilla, and charcoal, and sour mash grains. That combines with rich liqueur-like coffee, or maybe slow drip? Has a good deep cocoa note about it too, and burnt, almost blackened sugar.
Mouthfeel is what gets me first - this is not nearly as rich as most beers of this strength - quite well attenuated, dry, rather boozy, warm, get some woody tannin in there - very reminiscent of a swig of good Bourbon - that smoothness, yet dryness.
Palate doesn’t quite deliver what the nose promises, but it’s bloody nice! Bourbon up the wazoo - charred wood, sour mash twang, vanilla, toast, sort of overly ripe apricot, lots of wood! like massively. Chocolate, dark, coffee, strong, sugar, dark & strong & kinda burnt with burnt raisiny notes, smoky but not in a conventional manner. Smoooth finish, yet there’s a sort of acrid coffee & woody bitterness that counterpoints everything, sort of spurring you on as you take the journey.

3.1,"12 oz bottle—1st 6 pack I got was an outdated batch, which I didn’t notice till I was having the 1st beer from it and not enjoying it too much.  The first one fit a number of descriptions I’ve read on this beer, like-skunky, not much different than the US macros, shipping conditions that the beer was subjected to, etc..  The store was kind enough to do a swap for a different 6 pack with a more recent bottling date.  So, that’s the 6 pack I will rate as there was a big difference between the 2.    Pours a mild yellow, pale golden color, white head that is quite high, reduced to about 1/2 “ and held for much of that beers existence.  Aroma is light and citrusy, lime possibly? Along with a sweetness, possibly corn.  Carbonation and taste are good, an enjoyable beer.",Tsingtao,Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive

4.7,"Pours black with dense clingy caramel head. Sweet caramel bouquet. Incredibly silky mouth feel, with a cacophany of flavours swirling on the palate. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel, charcoal all separate then recombine on the finish which morphs into sticky date for the finale.

Tap is the worst, but.... a little shake of pepper and a frosty mug is the best way to enjoy the ""King of Beers"" . What hops?

The sediment(lots)at the bottom of our glasses is STUCK to the bottom and is orange. Put a pint with its MAAAASIVE thick dark brown head up to a bright pot light and there is zero light penetration. Speedway is a black hole of colour. 12% and easy drinking? That should be impossible. Incredibly black with unmistakable expressso flavor and a nice bitter after tast and I’m almost pissed cause we’re drinking it like water (sacreledge**).

update: Jan ’08: 2.5+ yr cellared bottle bought in Jan 2005, AR: choc, slight hops, strong coffee early on but the chocolate takes over. T: The hops become more obvious in the flavor, coffee, chocolate, dirt and earthy, pine. Notable alcohol burn. It definetly softened. Better when fresh.

The beer came in a 12 oz. brown bottle with an artful label. Pouring this beer turned my pint glass into a black hole through which no light could escape. Even holding the glass an inch from a 100 watt bulb revealed nothing about the interior. The head was dark brown and thick, and left gobs of clumpy brown lace all round the walls of the glass. The aroma was laden with coffee, chocolate, and raisins. The dry and roasty taste was that of burnt oats, coffee, and chocolate. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy, and aftertaste a bit warm. Like eating a coffee cake (without too much sugar), this meal in a glass satisfied nearly all senses, and left me in a state of fulfillment, and in grateful appreciation of the art of brewing.

There’s just a fantastic melange of the coffee with the bourbon, and there are notes of vanilla lurking deep within that complete an awesome, awesome aroma.  The taste follows very nicely from the nose; I love all of these rich, stout flavors that are present, and the bourbon adds a level of complexity without turning the beer into an alcoholic, boozy mess.  Fantastic.  The one drawback to this beer, which keeps it from perfection, is the finish, which resembles cigarettes and their ashes.

Not a super appealing look or smell to the beer. Has murky yellow color, with decent head, and an aroma of yeast. Yeast was very dominant in the flavor, their were slight notes of sweet and biterness. Would drink again off tap, but not out of the bottle.

truly ""clean"" beers you realize how artificial this beer tastes. In terms of appearance there is nothing really wrong or right about it, but the smell is a little skunky and metallic. Yes, the hop profile is more evident than say, Budweiser, but is that a good thing? No, it’s a very bad thing, because in this case the skunky and metallic qualities in the aroma also constitute the flavor!

4.5,"22 oz bottle courtesy of pepsican. The pour is a beautiful golden orange with a thick bright white head and some incredibly clingy and soapy lace. The aroma is incredible. The tropical fruits and floral hops are just dynamite. There is a lot of fruity complexity that I was not expecting for a American pale. There is just a hint of a piney resin to let me know there is some good dank hoppiness happening. The flavor is just as incredible. There is a lot tropical fruits, specifically pineapple and mango, the floral hops continue throughout there is a little pine on the back end, which really brings this thing home. The mouth feel is great. Just thick enough with a wonderful carbonation and it hangs around. The aftertaste is great lots of grapefruit and orange.

(Green bottle shipped to Japan = Skunked every single time.  Nice frothy head on this crystal clear, golden brew.  Sadly, the aroma is overtaken by the skunk.

0.5,Can courtesy of dragonstout at the Otown December tasting. Murky light pink pour. Very nice aroma of sweet tomato juice. Flavor was watered down tomato juice and black pepper. I actually preferred the bud light version!! THis one was too tart and ummm gross.,Budweiser Chelada,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive
1.6,Basically the same as it's non light brother. This seems to be more watery than regular Corona. Pours amber with a decent head. The scent is of slight citrus and malt blended with some hops. Good when its very cold and sickening otherwise. Beware.,Corona Light,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative
3.3,Aroma is quite nice but my only description is belgium smelling.  It pours a cloudy gold with a thick white head that quickly fades.  The taste is light yet crisp.  It’s complex like most Belgians yet sessionable and very easy to get down.  Not really outstanding but a very solid beer all around.,Hoegaarden,Positive,Negative,Neutral,Positive
3.9,"Tap at Luppolo Station in Rome. Black pour with a frothy brownish foam. Nose: powdered barley with highlights of caramel far away and licorice root. Mouth: I expected a sweet porter...no way. It is a classical porter, easy, bitter, not watery but rich of burnt maltiness although clean. The aftertaste is row burnt malts. Lovely",Founders Porter,Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive
3.7,Love the citrus aroma.  One of the best and easiest to find American Pale ales out there.  Has a smooth bitterness with a very slight lingering after taste.  Not much malt flavor.  A very good beer.,Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (Bottle/Can),Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive

0.9,"Well...

Poured a lovely, grapefruit-juice pink. No, really, it was a nice color, until you think ""wait, this is beer."" Smells like Clamato (tomato, celery, clams...) and Bud Light (shitty beer, adjuncts, my taste buds dying...). Tastes salty, and like Clamato, with a kick in the finish that screams ""YEAAAAAAAAAAAAH SON! BUD LIGHT, BABY!""

I’ll admit that Clamato on it’s own, while sounding pretty nasty, isn’t that unappealing to me - I like clams, and I like V8. However, the fizz and off-flavors of Bud Light are not suitable for pairing with... well, hell, I don’t think anyone should be mixing Bud Light with anything.  What a mess.",Bud Light Chelada,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive

4.4,"From bottle at Holiday Wine Cellar’s private tasting in January 2011.  Pours almost pitch black with lighter brown around the edges.  Only a thin layer of brownish foam.  Aroma is full of creamy espresso along with bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and chocolate.  Flavor is veyr complex and starts with a huge wallop of syrupy-sweet bourbon followed by more rich espresso, fudge, vanilla, caramel, rich molasses, rum, and some spice.  It’s not overly heavy, boozy but pleasantly so.  Has some nice lingering bourbon.  Altogether excellent.

Pours pale yellow with a limited head; the aroma is a simple, sweet pale lager and the flavor is well - uninspired, though at least it is adequately dry without too painful a graininess.I guess the best thing I can say is that I don’t dislike this beer - it is not particularly objectionable, as long one doesn’t go in with any expectations.

3.9,"My first Eisbock. Also by far the strongest beer I had until now. The experience is intense! Dark brown with little tan head. Aroma: Marzipan, clove, banana, and much more, that I have a hard time to describe. Taste: Overwhelming... Almost a little too much of everything. Sweetness was the foremost. Also a considerable amount of alcohol warmth. But less direct than this sounds.-- Comparing this directly with the Aventinus: much less hops, much more sweetness.

Given time, however, the aroma clears to reveal a lightly sweet macro-esque lager nose with just a whisper of dry grass in the background.

4.7,"Very delicious imperial stout.  Pours a dark black color with a caramel colored head.  Has an aroma of bourbon with hints of coffee, vanilla, and malt.  The alcohol comes through on the smell and taste.  This stout has it all sweet and malty on the front, bitter and biting alcohol on the back.  Thin mouthfeel.  Notes of vanilla and coffee which linger on the tongue through the finish.  This is most definitely a snifter worthy stout.  October 19, 2011 - had a 2011 bottle celebrating the birth of my son.  I think this brew really starts to hit its stride 6 months after the release.  

2010 Bottle on November 20, 2010.  This is drinking even better now.  The beer has mellowed perfectly, perhaps a bit more creamy.

Dec. 16, 2010, a growler fill from Bowery Beer Room.  7-8 months and this brew is really good.  The coffee bite and booziness mellow, and the creaminess kicks up.  I am tasting more chocolate than I did a month ago.",Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive

3.9,"From a 12 oz bottle with bottle date 10/14/14. Consumed Halloween night. Pours dark dark brown, light coming through at the sides, two finger cinnamon head. I could smell the coffee immediately after cracking the cap. So much coffee in the nose, the coffee just dominates everything else. Slightly roasty, just a tinge of alcohol, but not so much chocolate. Taste follows the nose, bitter coffee, a very little bit of alcohol, the chocolate sweetens it up a little bit, but the thing there I can’t shake is this underripe green pepper flavor. Maybe that’s the coffee. I don’t know, but I don’t necessarily like it. Still pretty good. Medium bodied, I was expecting something fuller.

Taste was somewhat lacking, but what was there was a hint of sweetness followed up by some lemon zest sourness along with a brief wheaty finish.

4.2,"From a 355ml bottle on 27/4/2017 (2016 edition, 11.9% abv). Pours near black with a small tan head. Has a strong aroma of chocolate, coffee and bourbon. The flavour is huge, and similar to the standard Breakfast Stout, but with the bourbon edge and some extra booziness. It features masses of chocolate and coffee, some vanilla and hints of caramel, with some light roasty bitterness. the palate is thick and creamy, and the carbonation soft.

Nice mouthfeel, and man, there’s a lot of coffee in here. I wish there was a bit more carbonation - it isn’t quite lively enough. Really nice flavor, though - and I could see this being great in the late morning / early afternoon hours (though that’s still a concept I’m not used to).

1.6,"Pretty bad, cheap-tasting lager.  In my opinion, Stella Artois is about on par with most American macro lagers.  There’s very little to recommend it.  The color is a pale, drab yellow.  The small white head dissipates very quickly.  There’s little aroma, except for a muted cheap malt note, overly sweet and more reminiscent of corn than barley, although I don’t believe that adjuncts are used.  The flavor is similarly dominated by a cheap, overly sweet malt flavor.  There are some hops in there, I guess.  The beer is not entirely without crispness when cold.  Still, the feel is rather thin, even for a lager probably based on a pilsner style.  Overall, I’m not a fan of Stella.  The flavor is unclean, which is a pretty big problem for me in a light lager.",Stella Artois,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive
1.8,"330 ml white can with pull tab, available just about everywhere in HK. This one bought at DCH Food Mart in Sheung Shui.



Piss-like pale yellow colour; Virtually no head and residual white foam which fades in 10 seconds; No lacing and notable carbonation; Initially pungent smell of skunk and malt which thankfully died down very fast, plus light corn syrup and rice with hint of wet cardboard; Sweet taste of malt, rice, light corn syrup, hint of wet cardboard, and barely noticeable trace of grass; Light body with watery and syrupy palate; Hoppiness is skunk nose, otherwise almost undetectable and has no finish. Wet after taste, extremely easy to mouth.



Comments: Oh my goodness. My childhood memory of Tsingtao was quite decent, particularly the Export, which was very crisp, strong and tasty. Fast forward to present: this once reputable national brand has now become just another anonymous, lowly Asian macro released under a confusing array of abvs and degree Platos, almost all of them failed to impress. Back to this beer: its taste is considerably better than the all - cardboard Tsingtao 10°. Still, it’s a typical macros, with watery body, skunk, syrupy corn and rice, no hoppiness and after taste whatsoever. Tailor made for non-discerning consumers, very inoffensive, you can even consider it as decent by crappy macro standards. It could have been a nice substitution for Tsingtao 10° to cut down the chili heat of Sichuan cuisines. All being said and done, this is a tasting exercise went without a hitch and hopefully I don’t have to taste it again.",Tsingtao,Negative,Negative,Negative,Neutral

Bottle brown, 330 ml

Appearance: Pours deep rubby red body colour, carbonation of the body is mild, head is slightly off white, almost cappuccino  like in colour, foamy to frothy but not that big as in the previous one, quickly decreasing to small and than lasting for a long time.

Aroma: Burned malt, some very thin regular malty touch, burned sugar with very gentle aromatic, a bit flowery hoppy notes, a bit creamy and sweety, some weak aroma of red fruits, plum reminding some bottom fermented Dunkels or Dunkels Hefeweissbiers.

Flavour: Dominated by bitterness, in a quite high level  becoming present on palate after the first sip. Strong roasted grains, coffee accents, ash pot and some flowery aromatic hoppy nose, slightly accidic at  finish. Alcohol is well hidden and far a 6.5% it is present slightly at finish but all in all is well balanced. Finish duration is medium to long.

Evaluating it against other pilsners, it is a good non-disappointing choice that goes well with pizza and most of the meals. 

The aroma is satisfying. It does not foam too much (unless someone does not how to do it right).

2.3,"Pilsener Urquell is one of those things people love to defend.  I would agree with those noble altruists that it is something like a fragile child in a world of more muscular, mature and intelligent beers.  I simply disagree about nurturing its confidence back using self-defeating lies.  It isn’t a pale lager, and has no business scratching desperately for mediocrity with that lot, but I don’t think it’s the paramount example of Pils primacy that particular members portray it as.  My notes on the beer are brief, as was the time I had with it, but they are not complimentary.  It was a clear and lucid beer (maybe more so than your averaged canned beer) with a frothy white head.  This bubbly top had an entertaining way of weaving a nice webby pattern of lace down the glass as I finished it which helped dispel some of the prejudice I was holding against it.  The smell was blander – a pretty simple base of mineral water with a strange component to it which I can only explain as giving the beer a “lurking” sense about it.  Not necessarily evil lurking like Jack the Ripper lurking, just… like lurking to sneak into the kitchen and eat the last slice of chocolate cake kind of lurking.  The taste seemed very fresh and dry but missing most of any flavor, opting to go in the other direction and actually taste bad.  Maybe I was drunk by this time but my notes read “Tastes like polluted rain water filtered through crypts”.  I don’t remember it being so offensive that I actually thought it tasted like damp necrotic flesh, just that it didn’t taste very good.  Any slew of industrial elements put together with some kind of mold or dust would do the job just fine.  I seriously wonder if my bottle was somehow tainted because the reviews seem to be a great deal more positive than I would have it.  To its credit I’ve heard how important it is to drink Pilsener Urquell fresh which rarely happens, so for now I’ll relegate myself to having purchased an aged bottle and make a sincere effort to try it again when the opportunity arises.",Pilsner Urquell,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive

Pours a molasses/motor oil black. Head is very thin and colored like brown sugar and cinnamon with little staying power. Still this looks formidable.

The coffee and bittersweet chocolate dominate with a little oatmeal and mega-roasted malt texture. Hop grass complements nicely.

Very complex texture of deep-roasted malt, coffee and natural, unsweetened chocolate. Chocolate further syncs up with a mild oatmeal texture to provide an austere and dry but painfully compelling stout profile.

There’s nothing, I repeat...NOTHING bad about the mouthfeel on this one. Rich yet dry and even clean for something so huge. Full finish gives off a little oatmeal chocolate chip sweetness. Definitely Beautiful Chemistry working here.

Smells of ground wheat with whisps of banana odor and a very slight ester.

Taste starts out with a strong wheat and fades to a more malty flavor, with evident elements of citrus, banana, and cloves.

Mouthfeel is medium weight with lots of carbonation as expected in this type, and a nice smoothness at the end. The initial ""hit"" of the carbonation and wheat is very refreshing, and the barley notes ensure a finish that’s not too harsh.

Rated: 27.07.2009

Can 500 ml, rated in Bogacs, Hungary.

Appearance: Pours pale yellow, even very pale, looks like stale in terms of colour, texture is not good too, it is not clear because there are some sediments floating in the body texture, carbonation is weak too, head is regular white initially medium to small, quickly decreasing to practically  non-existant, there are some weak traces of lacing, head is fizzy to foamy in texture.

Aroma: Very weak, slightly metalic and sourish from corn adjunct offspins, very weak and faint aromatic hoppy nose is almost non-catchable, paper, dust, corn grains but very stale and weak, on the verge of non-existant but not negative.

Flavour: Front is hazy light, neutral, reminding spring or mineral water, some mineral accents and gentle carbonation sourness, worked down corn, very weak in terms of extract of wort and a lot of water neutralizing the flavour, quite neutral, flat with short finish duration, very weak notes of metalic sourness and gentle thin hoppyness in nose.

Palate: Body is light, texture is wattery, carbonation on palate is rather soft, finish feel is neutral, flat.",Bernstein Sör,Negative,Neutral,Negative,Negative
3.9,"Big ol’ 24 oz bottle, rated 8/22/2005. Original rating moved to the draft version. Light brown body, pours a ""dirty"" fluffy head: that is, it leaves little bits of lace as it fades.

Just as much fun from the bottle as on draft.",Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (Bottle/Can),Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive
1.2,So what do you do when you have band practice and the corner store only sells swill? You grab a random unrated macro and chuckle about the inevitable rating you will give it. I even wrote down notes for this one like it was a real beer! Pours a piss-like yellow with almost no head. Aroma is of um.......something beer like with corn. Flavor gets an extra point for being unnoticeable which is better than offensive.

1.6,"Apparently good all year round. No. Designed, not crafted - it’s a minimalistic aesthetic manifested in beer format - and it’s bad.

3.7,"The first time I had this beer (a long time ago now), I didn’t like it. I thought it was too soapy. But now, (a long time later) I’ve matured and learnt to appreciate the qualities of a good beer. This was a very pleasant, light-tasting beer tasting of wheat and spices, but smooth enough that the spices are still not overpowering. Two thumbs up! Thanks to RichJ7 for refreshing my memory on this one!",Hoegaarden,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive
3.9,"OK, it’s an Inbev, but it’s bloody good. Pours cloudy auburn, creamy foamy off white head which lasts. Lovely aroma of banana bread and hint of allspice.

The expected banana scent that accompanies most Weizen beers is quite subdued. Taste is yeasty, sour, and fruity, light chocolate with some mineral notes in the finish. The palate is marred by a lightly watery character. Decent. Refreshing. But not up to the best of the class.

3.7,"Pours a deep brown with a toffee colored, one finger head that dissipates quickly into a thin glaze on the top of the beer. 

Smells a little boozy, plums, dark berries, unsweetened chocolate. Taste is a little smokey, some wood, espresso, chocolate. A nice little warmth from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. 

Overall a good Imperial Stout. Not the best, but a respectable one nonetheless.",Sierra Nevada Narwhal Imperial Stout,Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive

2.4,"Keg at Schiphol Airport
Having previously worked in the Netherlands for many years, I feel this beer hasn’t been given a fair chance in recent ratings, so I had a quick taste on a flying visit to Amsterdam today.


On draught it’s a pale straw colour with a dense lasting white head, it smells of grain with a metallic edge, it’s cold, sweet and refreshing with a hint of bitterness, but is a bit cloying afterwards.

This beer is best drunk as the Dutch do, cold and in small servings, with friends. It’s not intended to be the centre of attention, so doesn’t merit rating as a serious beer. However, in my opinion beer is always preferable to cola, so that makes this one OK.",Heineken,Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Positive

3.9,"Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a weizen glass. Appearance is a hazy copper with a 1.5 finger width head with dark brown splotches from the yeast. Aroma reminds me of banana’s foster with its notes of brown sugar, bananas, vanilla, and rum. In the taste I get a fruity, raisiny sweetness that moves to an earthy, cooked banana overtone in the finish. The beer is a touch thinner in body than I would prefer, but that doesn’t put me off too much. Overall, this beer great.

3.7,"(500ml bottle from Spec’s on October 11, 2008) You’d think this was a dunkel from the looks of the bottle.  Pours a gorgeous orange with a solid, white frothy head and lacing that slides down the glass. Its aroma is of a serious German Weizenbock. Very sour, citric, and yeasty.  Smells like a brewery. Smells like fermented wheat! Its taste is of banana, cloves, and a hint of hops.  Smooth going down, almost makes you want to pucker. A finely crafted beer.",Weihenstephaner Vitus,Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive
4.0,"12 oz. bottle courtesy of Secret Santa. Pours black with a moderately large brown head that left lots of sticky lace while it quickly receded.  Very pleasant aroma of coffee and roasted malt.

With A after an amazing day of Lancaster, KoP & Steakn’Shake. 

Poured from bottle. Hazy orange with a big fluffy white head. 

Nose is huge with lots of wheat, yeast and fruit. 

Taste is soft, creamy and sweet with wheaty flavors dominating over yeasty notes and dried fruit. Balanced and very flavorful with lots of sweetness and basically no bitterness. 

Palate is soft with great fluffy carbonation. Wheat flavors lingering. 

Overall, the first weizenbock I’ve had and everything a wheat beer should be. This is amazing!",Weihenstephaner Vitus,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive

I can have St.Ambroise Noire à l’Avoine everyday, but still, a pint of Guinness is an experience. It’s like opening up a can of Ireland and being Irish for 20 minute.

Very cold it can be refreshing because it’s totally harmless but as it warms up it starts to taste something and the something is not very good.
