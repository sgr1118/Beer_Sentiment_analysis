Nice aroma of roasted malt and coffee along with light leafy hops and chocolate. Flavour, which is even better, of roasted malt, coffee, light hops, some light lactic notes and a good amount of chocolate and a nice dry, roasty bitter finish. Medium to full bodied. A great Porter, well done!\n",

      "510 From a 12 oz bottle with bottle date 10/14/14. Consumed Halloween night. Pours dark dark brown, light coming through at the sides, two finger cinnamon head. I could smell the coffee immediately after cracking the cap. So much coffee in the nose, the coffee just dominates everything else. Slightly roasty, just a tinge of alcohol, but not so much chocolate. Taste follows the nose, bitter coffee, a very little bit of alcohol, the chocolate sweetens it up a little bit, but the thing there I can’t shake is this underripe green pepper flavor. Maybe that’s the coffee. I don’t know, but I don’t necessarily like it. Still pretty good. Medium bodied, I was expecting something fuller. As a guy who doesn’t drink coffee, I wasn’t sure if this was worth it, but it’s still pretty good.\n",

      "511 (bottle thanks OSLO) Pours a nice hazy gold with a large fluffy white head that retains nicely.  Aroma is strong of banana at first, with some clove also.  Upon warming, the smell morphs into more of an apple-like tartness, and bready notes make an appearance.  Taste was somewhat lacking, but what was there was a hint of sweetness followed up by some lemon zest sourness along with a brief wheaty finish.  Not a bad Hefe.\n",

Earthy, biscuity and some pie crusts with the malt profile. Very thick on the palate. Flavors of earth, peppery, a hint astringent from the dark roast. Bitter, chocolate. Bitter balance overall. Malty, woody, coffee, woodsie notes. Some tobacco. Could use a touch more malt sweetness for my palate. Creamy, full bodied, thick and velvety. Medium to light carbonation. Quite warming. Tasty.\n",

Well balanced sweetness and bitterness, with light smoky character and a slightly sour citrus taste in there too. It’s got the nice dry bite of a pilsner, with lively carbonation.

Aromas of dust, dirty malts and cellar yeasts. The mouth is very, very flat and watery. The brew has a medium carbonation. There is almost no ending at all. The taste has mint in it (well, this is something cool), and some malty bitterness. Well, this lager is not obnoxious. Really it is not...

The flavour is huge, and similar to the standard Breakfast Stout, but with the bourbon edge and some extra booziness. It features masses of chocolate and coffee, some vanilla and hints of caramel, with some light roasty bitterness. the palate is thick and creamy, and the carbonation soft. A magnificent brew, though my failure to fully embrace barrel aged beasties means I can’t rate it higher than the standard Breakfast edition.

Big aroma of stale coffee, some spices (anise, cloves?), and some of the traditional chocolate and molasses. But it’s definitely more roasty than sweet. Nice mouthfeel, and man, there’s a lot of coffee in here. I wish there was a bit more carbonation - it isn’t quite lively enough. Really nice flavor, though - and I could see this being great in the late morning / early afternoon hours (though that’s still a concept I’m not used to). Lots and lots of roasty coffee, layered over dark chocolate and burnt molasses. Nice, but honestly? I don’t think it’s quite worth the hype.\n",

Big nose of black coffee, burnt from being on the burner a little too long, with some biter dark chocolate mocha stirred in there.

Plenty of hop and cereal in mouth.  Lovely version of a weisse, like a weizen IPA.  Hops are quite resiny/piney, but goes well with the banana bubblegum.  What a lovely drink.  I had this as an aperatif to Sunday lunch after doing some work in the morning and felt like I’d earned it.  Alcohol doesn’t come through at all.  Some passionfruit/mango throughout.  Stunning.\n",

Not much lacing, but the head retains its consistency. Very skunky bottle smell hits at first, but underneath is a faint hop aroma. Tastes like water, but a tad bit of sweet malts and pleasant hops kick in after the swallow. Very faint and subtle altogether, but it’s pretty refreshing. Watery but hops add a bit of bitterness. Not worth the cost, but it’s very accessible; so maybe for a family party?\n",

The flavor follows with huge amounts of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, espresso, toasted caramel, and some hop bitterness. I bet the coffee would be really pronounced on draft. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous, but also incredibly smooth. There is a perfect balance between the chocolate and roastiness. Just an awesome imperial stout from an awesome brewery.\n",

It is on the expensive side but for those who havent tried it, its definitely a beer to try.\n",
      "Stella Artois 3.0\n",
      "702 Pretty bad, cheap-tasting lager.  In my opinion, Stella Artois is about on par with most American macro lagers.  There’s very little to recommend it.  The color is a pale, drab yellow.  The small white head dissipates very quickly.  There’s little aroma, except for a muted cheap malt note, overly sweet and more reminiscent of corn than barley, although I don’t believe that adjuncts are used.  The flavor is similarly dominated by a cheap, overly sweet malt flavor.  There are some hops in there, I guess.  The beer is not entirely without crispness when cold.  Still, the feel is rather thin, even for a lager probably based on a pilsner style.  Overall, I’m not a fan of Stella.  The flavor is unclean, which is a pretty big problem for me in a light lager.\n",

      "Comments: Oh my goodness. My childhood memory of Tsingtao was quite decent, particularly the Export, which was very crisp, strong and tasty. Fast forward to present: this once reputable national brand has now become just another anonymous, lowly Asian macro released under a confusing array of abvs and degree Platos, almost all of them failed to impress. Back to this beer: its taste is considerably better than the all - cardboard Tsingtao 10°. Still, it’s a typical macros, with watery body, skunk, syrupy corn and rice, no hoppiness and after taste whatsoever. Tailor made for non-discerning consumers, very inoffensive, you can even consider it as decent by crappy macro standards. It could have been a nice substitution for Tsingtao 10° to cut down the chili heat of Sichuan cuisines. All being said and done, this is a tasting exercise went without a hitch and hopefully I don’t have to taste it again.\n",

Flavor is chewed paper (spit ball contest anyone?) with light corn and rice notes, not much dinosaur dirty ice (but some) with a dry finish. I do not think hops came within 100 miles of this beer.

If you don’t know what green smells like sniff your Heiny.  Goodness!  The green has a flavor too.  Lick your Heiny to find out what it is like.

Less boozy than what aroma would suggest, but still boozy.

Sticky mouthfeel, perfect sugar balance, which is impressive considering how low on hops this one is. Yeast job? Maybe. Finale is rather long, but smooth.

Evaluating it against other pilsners, it is a good non-disappointing choice that goes well with pizza and most of the meals. \n",

      "The aroma is satisfying. It does not foam too much (unless someone does not how to do it right). The overall availability across Europe and the US indicates Stella's ambition to be the European beer of choice, dethroning Heineken, Carlsberg, or Budvar. I hope it will not get worse as the other beers did (with the exception of Budvar).\n",

Skunky smell from 2 feet away as I pour. Clears up to give me a nose of fizzy corn, not much in the way of malt or hops. C’mon, at least a Schaefer Light can smell like a beer. Taste is just this side of lackluster. Adjunct still predominates, but it’s not sugary. Clean finish unlike other headache-inducing cheap beers.

      "798 Pilsener Urquell is one of those things people love to defend.  I would agree with those noble altruists that it is something like a fragile child in a world of more muscular, mature and intelligent beers.  I simply disagree about nurturing its confidence back using self-defeating lies.  It isn’t a pale lager, and has no business scratching desperately for mediocrity with that lot, but I don’t think it’s the paramount example of Pils primacy that particular members portray it as.  My notes on the beer are brief, as was the time I had with it, but they are not complimentary.  It was a clear and lucid beer (maybe more so than your averaged canned beer) with a frothy white head.  This bubbly top had an entertaining way of weaving a nice webby pattern of lace down the glass as I finished it which helped dispel some of the prejudice I was holding against it.  The smell was blander – a pretty simple base of mineral water with a strange component to it which I can only explain as giving the beer a “lurking” sense about it.  Not necessarily evil lurking like Jack the Ripper lurking, just… like lurking to sneak into the kitchen and eat the last slice of chocolate cake kind of lurking.  The taste seemed very fresh and dry but missing most of any flavor, opting to go in the other direction and actually taste bad.  Maybe I was drunk by this time but my notes read “Tastes like polluted rain water filtered through crypts”.  I don’t remember it being so offensive that I actually thought it tasted like damp necrotic flesh, just that it didn’t taste very good.  Any slew of industrial elements put together with some kind of mold or dust would do the job just fine.  I seriously wonder if my bottle was somehow tainted because the reviews seem to be a great deal more positive than I would have it.  To its credit I’ve heard how important it is to drink Pilsener Urquell fresh which rarely happens, so for now I’ll relegate myself to having purchased an aged bottle and make a sincere effort to try it again when the opportunity arises.\n",

Then again, a jug of ice water would also be really refreshing.  I would go through 5 large bottles and never feel a buzz - figure it must have been the heat sweating the \"premium ingredients\" out of my body.  One good thing, this stuff coated my belly against some nasty stuff that I ate at the roadside warungs and at Uluwatu.  Maybe it should be sold beside Pepto Bismo?!?

Wowzer, one of the thickest beers I’ve ever tasted, really creamy texture with some burnt flavours, coffee slightly and burnt chocolate with a cereal hint. Solid of it’s style, nothing outlandish but it says what it does with perfection. Feels like cool liquid chocolate in the back of my throat. I would prefer it if it were slightly less ’grainy’ and sort of crisper and rich in flavour whilst still having this wonderful thick texture but that’s just a personal preference. Amazing beer\n",

A light maltiness with some grass and lemon notes. There is just a touch of a chemical note in the finish. Not something I would drink by choice, but for what it is, it isn’t too shabby.\n",

      "972 From memory, I honestly could not taste any difference between the regular and the light MGD.  Other than the labels, it was pretty much the same beer.\n",
      "Miller Genuine Draft MGD Light 1.7\n",
      "973 Chestnut brown color with a medium tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Roasted malts, chocolate, toffee, semi sweet finish.\n",
      "Kozel Černý (Dark) 10° 3.6\n",
      "974 pours a golden yellow color. taste is very clean and refreshing. definitely couldn’t be copied or immitated very well.\n",
      "Pilsner Urquell 3.4\n",
      "975 an easily forgetable beer, for lack of anything special, and the ability to get you drunk quickly\n",
      "Bud Ice 1.5\n",
      "976 Big & roasty! Excellent black pour w/ a lovely mocha head & good lacing. The aroma is dark chocolate & some roasted notes. The flavor is quite roasty w/ just enough chocolate sweetness to balance it out. Pretty solid imperial!\n",
      "Sierra Nevada Narwhal Imperial Stout 3.7\n",
      "977 This tastes better than bud in that the cereal graininess is not as prevalent.  I actually can handle this one almost as easily as miller lite or blue light when getting drunk, much better than coors lite. almost has a taste to it too.\n",
      "Bud Light 0.8\n",
      "978 A pint o’ Guinness on St.Paddy’s Day. Some juges this beer much too hard on it’s taste compared to other Stout available worldwide. I can have St.Ambroise Noire à l’Avoine everyday, but still, a pint of Guinness is an experience. It’s like opening up a can of Ireland and being Irish for 20 minute. Dark, but not black, creamy, salty/bitter, watery by the end...Still, a pint of something more than a beer.\n",
      "Guinness Draught 3.8\n",
      "979 I’ve said it before... I wish they had a nostalgia rating.  If they did, this beer would get higher score than it did.  I really enjoy this beer and it reminds me of my years living in japan.  it really isn’t any better (or worse) than any major us or canadian macro.  i wish i could get a hold of some Japan brewed stuff.\n",
      "Asahi Super Dry 2.4\n",
      "980 I can’t find my notes so I’ll go on memory. Light and refreshing. I remember lemon chiffon.\n",
      "Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc 3.2\n",
      "981 One of the best things I had in my mouth. Would recommend ta add in TO DO list before dying. The aroma is so tempting, but it does not prepare you for emotion blast when tasting it.\n",
      "AleSmith Speedway Stout 4.7\n",
      "982 Serving type: bottle\n",
      "\n",
      "Appearance- Pours a cloudy yellow with a slight orange tint. Good white head that hung around for about half the beer very light lacing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aroma- Smell of wheat, citrus and banana\n",
      "\n",
      "T/P- Taste of banana very light. Heavily carbonated al most to the point of too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall- Very good, I like wheats and there is defiantly better once out there, but all in all this one is good.\n",
      "Paulaner Hefe-Weissbier 3.5\n",
      "983 Clear yellow body, short-lived little white head.  Lightly malted, lightly hopped, lightly everything.  Light on taste.  Very cold it can be refreshing because it’s totally harmless but as it warms up it starts to taste something and the something is not very good.  When the most popular beer in the Netherlands is the Heineken it’s no wonder that they came-up with the Amsterdam concept so people could at least smoke themselves silly.\n",
      "Heineken 1.3\n",
      "984 Smell is sweet and inviting, reminding me a wee heavy. Pour had a small head that diminished quickly. Color was red and looks thick. Taste was sweet and had a high ABV bite, but well masked. Palate was full and a bit acrid.\n",
      "Schneider Weisse Tap 09 - Aventinus Eisbock 3.8\n",
      "985 Bottle 20$ from capones, split with Brian K.  Jet black impst with creamy white/tan head.  Flavor and aromatics are coffee, chocolate, etoh, and very roasty.  A good stout. 3.8\n",
      "What the HELL WAS I THINKING.  This beer freaking rocks.  A black abyss with a coffee tan head.  Liquid bakers chocolate, fresh roasted coffee, lactose and molasses. A dark chocolate roast with hints of vanilla and minerals.  This is off the chart good! 4.6\n",
      "AleSmith Speedway Stout 4.6\n",
      "986 Decent head, fruity aroma. Clear pale golden body.\n",
      "Tastes like sparkling water. One of the most drinkable yet boring international pale lagers.\n",
      "Heineken 2.5\n",
      "987 Beer flavored water for sure. Nothing offensive, reminds me of Coors light, but VERY BLAND.\n",
      "Busch Beer 1.1\n",
      "988 Not worth the bother.  Any commercial beer like this is, for the most part crap.  Drink a microbrew instead, much healthier for you.  The horses are good, though.\n",
      "Budweiser 0.5\n",
      "989 Not good at all.  My friend said I’d love it, its a great lager.  He was wrong, I hate it.  yellow, no hop flavoring, no aroma\n",
      "Stella Artois 0.5\n",
      "990 Not much aroma, a little bit of pine i suppose.  Pours a deep amber with a small quarter inch head that dissapates quickly.  Taste is rich and malty with nice cascades coming through.  medium bodied, overall a pretty good beer\n",
      "Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (Bottle/Can) 3.2\n",
      "991 Thanks to the very generous Vance for this one.  Opaque black pour and forms a half inch brown head that disappears and leaves only a ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass.  The aroma has mostly coffee notes with a bit of sweet chocolate.  The flavor is very smooth, slightly bitter with coffee and baker’s chocolate in the finish.  What an amazing beer.\n",
      "Founders Breakfast Stout 4.2\n",
      "992 Bottle from Waitrose. Pours cloudy and quite dark brown with a frothy head. The malt aroma is accompanied by yeast, Heavier in body and flavour than Leffe blonde with overtones of more roasted malt balancing the yeast; of the 2 I’d choose this one.\n",
      "Leffe Brune / Bruin / Brown 3.8\n",
      "993 Dank........................................................................\n",
      "Paulaner Hefe-Weissbier 3.8\n",
      "994 330ml bottle. Small glazed white foam. Quite easy carbonation, small bubbles. Aroma has apples, yeast and sour pineapple which disguises the wheat. Flavour is more wheat, some apple fruit, there is soap here and some citric sense by the sides of the tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone\n",
      "Edelweiss Weissbier Snowfresh 3.5\n",

      "996 50cl bottle. Golden color with big white head. Rich malty nose. Malty crisp taste. Good carbonation.\n",
      "Egger Märzenbier 2.3\n",
      "997 Pours dark reddish brown with a few mm’s of light brown head. Aroma is earthy, roasted notes, caramel, nuts. Flavours are more caramel, subtly roasted notes and chocolate, light grassy hops in the finish. Not much complexity, but a nice beer. Loads of flavour for the low abv, and as expected, a bit thin.\n",
      "Kozel Černý (Dark) 10° 3.1\n",
