"milwaukee s best as a light beer? the full strength one is already as light as they come. oh well this brew pours a very light yellow gold brew with hardly any head. maybe a little film on the side of glass. aroma is very light corn bread, hardly any detected floral hops and a faint nose of almond. strange! flavor is hardly there. finish is less gritty than the full strengthed milwaukee s best because it is mostly water. milwaukee s best light did not exist in the 1950s but there was a milwaukee s best bock from a. gettelman brewing company. my grandfather told me that gettelman s milwaukee s best bock of the 1950s had a high demand from beer drinkers, comparable to surly darkness of the 21st century.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"24oz can bought from wal-mart for 1.97. what a rip-off appearance dark pinkish red, extremely hazy. some head but it fizzles away fast like a soda. aroma fish and salt with a slight hint of bud light. taste this may be the worst thing i have ever intentionally put in my mouth. the best way to describe it would be puke in a can. it literally tastes like vomit mixed with ocean water. i could only drink about 6 of the 24oz and had to dump it. it left me feeling queezy. just thinking about it makes me nauseous. ugh. mouthfeel ever gone to the ocean and accidentally opened your mouth when a wave crashed on you? it s kinda of like that, only you did it on purpose. drinkability undrinkable. maybe if this came in a bottle and you stuck a lime in the neck like corona is might be drinkable, but it s so terrible i d bet a lot of cash no one can finish an entire 24oz can of this. this is quite possibly the stupidest idea in the history of consumer goods. clamato by itself is already a dumb idea to add bud light to it plus salt and lime is pure torture. i cannot believe this beer-ish product is still being produced. who the hell drinks this crap",Negative,Negative,Negative

"i m more fascinated by the light beer style than anything else i think it s a social pressure thing, that people want to be seen drinking beer even though they hate beer. or, they think they will get drunk too fast and need a beer that is unintrusive. either way, the light beers fill a market need and who are we to deny them the opportunity to cash in on people too narcissistic to just order soda water with vodka? thus, i pour this at room temperature - the only way to truly taste the varying flavours of a light beer - it pours a urine yellow with almost no head. aroma of sweetened carboard and a bit of candy that you found under the couch cushions one friday night while drunk. flavour is water with a weak grainy-cardboard aftertaste. seriously, is their answer to the light question to just make it more watery? poor showing, corona. you suck.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"had in a 0.5 l can. pours a gold colour with a frothy finger sized white head. smells skunky, cheap and of rice and grass. taste is of subtle malts, rice and hops. in my opinion, it is just like other asian beers- tiger, tsingtao, yinjang, sapporo, etc. cheap and plain.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"from notes. enjoyed at brot spiele at dinner with gary. 330 ml bottle. the pour is a very clear golden yellow color. there is no head or lace to be found with it. this looks like dehydrated piss, or maybe some apple juice. it s really interesting. the aroma is incredibly rice forward. there isn t much else. there is a light metallic malt and some wet cereal maybe. the flavor is just as light. there is almost nothing going on. it s light, ricey, and carries a little metallic with it. the mouth feel is terribly watery and hardly carbonated at all. the aftertaste is metallic rice and just jumps right off of the tongue. this isn t good.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"#50 country rating. 33 cl. bottle @ home purchased @ semi-local asian supermarket with the intent of finally ticking china as a country my biggest chinese want is still snow beer but since i figure i cannot really get hold of that one, this one should do the trick. tsingtao brewery was founded by german settlers german brewing traditions appear to play still a significant role in chinese brewing in 1903. its original name was actually even germania-brauerei . they are currently the second biggest chinese brewery, claiming 15 market share. ownership appears to have been rather volatile over the years but asahi appears to own the majority of the company these days, which must sort of hurt i assume that most chinese consumers are oblivious to these fact most non-chinese as well i am willing to bet. this beer here is their flagship and is supposed to be a pilsner, it is no longer brewed according to the reinheidsgebot nor by using mineral water from the laoshan spring, this is a bit unfortunate but these days this is mostly just a big factory lager. beer wise this remains still chinese biggest export, i am certain that quite a few people will have no difficulty recognising and naming this beer, no other major chinese export beers come to mind to me personally. the beer itself comes in a green bottle, perhaps aiming to play in the same luxury import market as for instance heineken does in the states? i must add that the cap is in a lovely communist red. anyway this hit has been a very, very long time i think since i drank anything that comes in a green bottle i cannot say that i really missed it. as most export versions over here appear to, my version also states an abv of 4.7 the price was reasonable compared to similar offerings taking the transportation costs into account. poured into a catastrophically inappropriate glass, the beer itself is an unpleasant, extremely pale macro pilsner yellow, like the lightest cider outside with some non-lasting white bubbles for a head it looks like a bottom of the barrel macro pilsner, it has been a while for me this is unabridged, real deal. smell is surprisingly not skunked but rather sweet, sweet, sugary, lemony urinal cakes with some grass and very cheap pastry. taste is bitter watery grains, cardboard, hay, light bitter aluminium, old apples, that part is ok but unfortunately the aftertaste is rather horrendous, it has this gross chemical, artificial sweetness going on, like baking powder mixed with industrial warehouses, it has this bizarre sweetness to it, lightly metallic, you sort of get used to but the first couple of sips hit you. it feels stale with a definably noticeable watery side to it. what can i say, this is like the poster boy for factory made mass, industrial pale lagers, this is exactly what pops into my head when i think of these kinds of beers. this is what people drink ice-cold from the bottle whilst looking for a relaxing, slow, cheaper buzz. this reminds me of stella artois. this can become almost agreeable, it is not that atrocious, unfortunately i do not feel like i am drinking the beer of the chinese factory worker, this is what the city yuppies drink in china privileged kids. i would dig this more if this felt like the chinese common mans drink.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"thick, dense from yeast, dark cola color, stable head. nice. a strong bubblegum and vanilla aroma, burnt malts, coffee, prune, grass, licorice. t deep licorice taste with mocha hint. development bit boozy, tingling, towards cough syrup. aftertaste is burnt malts, coffee, sticky. very heavy.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"bottle. aroma of alcohol, bitter chocolate, standard coffee. flavor was coffee, the chocolate, and lots of very nice vinous qualities. mouthfeel was a bit off for me, odd tingly carbonation, unusually clean for an impy, not at all rich and creamy, even when i tried to swirl out the carbonation that was throwing me off. all that vinousness reveals this beer to me as unquestionably worthy, but i can t say i was nearly as impressed as a 4.35 would suggest. rerate, bottle. very different mouthfeel this time, low carbonation, but instead overly muddy this may be the first time i ve really gotten a motor oil feel from an impy. still has some nice coffee and chocolate notes, but not as clean as many in the style.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"bottle. i really have not been into imperial stouts at all recetly, but i really really enjoyed this one. it was a perfect oil black pour with a nice dark khaki head . the aroma was vanilla, oak, and chocolate. the flavor was the same but with a major step up. the flavor with the palate made it taste and feel like a nice rich chocolate milkshake. the abv. was hidden very well. it got hotter as it warmed but was still very cozy and tasty. so smooth and easygoing. if you like imperial stouts you need to try this. if you don t you still need to taste this.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"poured from a 500ml bottle into a traditional weizen glass. a pours a dark apricot peach color with a torrent of bubbles rising upward before joining the monstrous four-finger head that has emerged after a standard pour. lacing is left behind as the wavy head finally begins to recede. s initial whiff is of course the german hefe yeast. this one seems to favor banana and, to a lesser extent, clove over the third member of the triumvirate--bubblegum. i m also detecting a faint hint of nuttiness, which adds a nice touch. as it warms up, a little bit more bubblegum characteristic comes through, replacing some of the initial banana. t surprisingly, a good amount of malt comes through alongside the yeast in this. the aftertaste, however, is dominated by clove and banana. a little bit of soft pink bubblegum on the palate. m medium body with a good amount of creaminess. some bitterness comes through. moderate carbonation. d pretty drinkable, although it doesn t have the intensity or intricacies that i look for in a really outstanding hefeweizen. serving type bottle reviewed on 02-17-2010",Positive,Positive,Positive

"as with miller, there are some light corn hints to this beer, so it would be inaccurate to say it s completely flavorless. it s also inoffensive. that is the best i can say about it, and all of this means it s borderline 2 at best. if you love pale lagers for whatever reason, grab yourself a stella instead.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"the fact that mgd has a higher avg. rating than miller s plank road offering, red dog, is a joke. yet another marketing induced bias. i have long considered mgd and bud light to be the worst non-budget beers made in america. they are the two beers that i would avoid at all costs, that i would not drink even if they were the only beers available. but, i had yet to rate mgd, so i managed to choke one down in the interests of ratebeer. in the old days, mgd had a bit of a faint flourescent green hue. i didn t notice that this time maybe they found a way to strain out the chlorine. i also didn t notice the skunkiness that seemed to pervade early batches. but, at least that gave mgd some distinction. this brew is about as innocuously bland as you can get. miller makes a pretty decent lite, but this stuff is bad. the best thing i can say is that it leaves surprisingly good lace.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"skunked aroma and flavor. ugh! beautiful clear light gold with brilliant white dense head. fizzy, watery mouthfeel. for the last time green bottles are pretty, but they do not protect your beer from ultraviolet light! when i was young, i thought grolsch heineken beck s were supposed to taste this way. i never liked them. now i know why they were skunked. i also realize that there is probably an entire generation of north american men who have never tasted an un-skunked german pilsener pale lager. their sole experience with this style of beer was an unfortunate episode involving a soured lowenbrau in 1988. please no more green bottles for us yanks and canucks! you are losing out on a huge market because your product is damaged by the time we get it. sorry for the rant, everyone",Negative,Negative,Negative

"reviewed 3 6 13. this was probably the first beer i bought that i truly loved, so i ve been meaning to revisit this one for a long time. 12 oz bottle into a weizen glass. a pours a darker amber color that seems both less hazy and fizzier-looking than others in the style. the head is a beautiful five-finger pale cream color. it has one of the softest-looking textures i ve ever witnessed in any beer head, and retains itself reasonably. s this one is relatively clove-forward, with the general malts being the secondary aromatic feature. it seems like this one comes off drier than most. t differing from the nose, the flavor itself is quite banana-forward to start. the banana esters will fade to a midtaste finish of lactic cream, wheat, and cloves. no real depth here, just a solid no-frills hefeweizen. m i wondered if the feel would be dry due to the lack of a sweet nose - and i was wrong. this is a creamy, semi-sweet weizen, and pulls it off well. the thickness of the texture conceals the high carbonation somewhat, but as the carbonation fades, it seemingly becomes dry - very nearly to the point of being watery. on the plus side, it becomes more drinkable this way. o i don t know if this is quite the beer i fell in love withah well, it s still good stuff. and it s available practically everywhere to boot.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"i recently had the pleasure of drinking this beer on tap, i saw the bar back cart up the keg from the basement and i got the first pour. the result was awesome, a dark, rich and thick beer with two fingers of creamy beige head. the flavor was rich with tones of coffee and bread. it was like drinking a beer milkshake, a very satisfying delicious beer for a reasonable price.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"born on date 05 feb 2008. i guess the key to drinking this beer is to have it 2.5 years after its born on date. pours a straw yellow, very high carbonation and a quick fading white bubbly head. aroma is corny and sweet nose with not too much else in there. flavor is sweet with no hops and a mild grainy note. body thin, texture is fizzy and its overall nothing exciting. for a light beer it has a bit more flavor than the rest but i serious think the aging took a bit outta it. overall nothing i am going to go outta my way for but something i might consider for a party where folks don t enjoy craft brew.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"rated on 10-02-2013 this beer pours a medium sized tan head that mostly diminished, dark brown opaque body, spotty amounts of lacing, and fast rising carbonation. the aroma is malty, chocolate, coffee, roasty, and hint of spice. the taste is bitter, malty, coffee, chocolate, roasty burnt. the palate is smooth and this beer is light-medium bodied. in conclusion, this beer is very quaffable, worth trying and i am surprised that i have not already rated this until now. it is a very roasty beer all the way around and i recommend this beer if one likes porter styled beers.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"do not try to drink one of these 750s by yourself. bad idea. this beer is beyond massive. it pours pitch freaking black with a thick brown head, textbook. aroma is coffee and some bitter chocolate. taste is coffee but it s really good, complex, acidic coffee. then the smooth chocolatey notes come in and the massive body of the beer is revealed. then it finishes with more light roasted coffee notes. excellent imperial stout. but i prefer them barrel aged when they re this strong.",Positive,Positive,Positive

this is the benchmark by which i measure all that is evil the huge brand with big market share that gets by on the strength of their marketing budget even though their smaller competitors are clearly better because they had to water down everything in order to cater to the mass markets. budweiser is the pentium. budweiser is disney. budweiser is nike. budweiser is what makes me cringe at my staunch capitalist beliefs.,Negative,Negative,Negative

killer stuff here. golden yellow pour with an large and fluffy white head. big banana aroma with some clove and maybe cereal. the flavor is huge here. lots of the aforementioned banana clove stuff going on with a fuckload of hops thrown in for good measure. honey sweetness and a bit of cantaloupe as well. well made beer that should sit alongside aventinus and aventinus eisbock for all of eternity.,Positive,Positive,Positive

"holy hell. one of the very buck wildest beers i ve ever had. bourbon county stout is awesome but this snuffs out even a cellared bourbon county without question. smell is heavy with bourbon and seemingly both chocolate and vanilla. coffee is present but not overwhelming. pour is black as night with zero head, almost exactly like coffee but with a few bubbles, texture mouth is fairly similar as well. these things are all pretty cool and all, but the taste, fuck me! it is one of the weirdest, most multifaceted flavors i ve ever come across, if not of all time. bourbon wood up front, hops come second , then chocolate, then smoke, tapering to a bizarre sour finish then the hops come back and linger and finally somehow the smoke trails back in and joins them. there are literally seven distinct layers. this is a ludicrous brew and one of the best i ve ever had.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"bottle - sample at ontario brewing awards event. i d been waiting for a chance at a free sample to rate this one, and the opportunity finally arrived a few days ago. pours a very pale yellow with a wan white head. aroma is very mild, with hints of wet grain and apple. flavour well, it seems strange to use the word flavour in reference to this beverage, as it really tastes like mineral water with a bit of lager mixed in, and a vague unclassifiable sweetness. i was hot from walking down to the bar on a very warm day, and it was cold from sitting in a tub of ice, so it went down easily, but so would water. to give a completely fair rating, i probably should have let it warm up some, but i honestly don t think it would have made much of a difference.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"i cannot think of another beer that is as well known internationally and is also a great beer. it s best, if you get it from the tap in a country that allows using nitrogen, but even then you need someone at the bar that takes the time to tap it correctly. if you don t trust the bar staff, go for the extra cold tap. if the first sip is crisp and refreshing and you drink past the bottom of the harp in your pint-glass before you can put it down, it is well tapped. the tins with the widget improve the experience over bottles or tins without, but still only manage to draw even with a badly tapped guinness.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"500 ml, bb date reads 15.september 2011 therefore quite a fresh one, into tulip. hazy straw-yellow colored body topped by thick, rather low white head that slowly recedes and sticks to the walls. weizenbock is essentially a dunkelweizen brewed to the strength of a bock, however, the pale visual appearance of vitus is reminiscent more of a hefeweizen than dunkleweizen. aroma is doppelbock-like sweetness with banana esters, clove phenolics and bready malt. a careful sniffing session reveals plum raisin-like fruitiness that gets more prominent as the beer warms. very faint alcohol shines through. flavor is rich sweetness with banana, clove and wheat. hop flavor is virtually absent and the finish is somewhat balanced by light hoppy bitterness and very faint alcohol. the palate is sweet, body medium-full with very smooth creamy texture and moderate carbonation. as stated above, the appearance of vitus resembles a good hefeweizen although it is easily distinguished from the later by having a minor head and fuller body. there could be more melanoidin dark fruit character but it s a very decent beer nevertheless.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"bottle brought home from prague, bought in albert supermarket fine, clear mahogany-brown colour. high, airy, foam that dissapears too quickly. the aroma is marked by obvious chocolate, caramel, some liquorice and malts. the aroma leaves no traces of the hops, but is very appealing. the flavor is quite complex with a lot of chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. some caramel appears too, and even notes of liquorice are hiding in there. the liquorice are getting more obvious towards the finish, when the beer gets more sourish and dry too. the finish is quite bitter, and fits the beer. this might sound exciting, but somehow the taste in itself still manage to give a bit of a boring impression. it might be because of the dryishness. this beer is only a little creamy, and it would suit it being more. it could be sweeter too, together with less dry. all in all this is a quite nice dunkel, though. all in all 3.4. 15.05.2010 re-rating as my brother brought by a can. appearance is a little better this time - head lasts better, but still not long enough. aroma is not as appealing as earlier, less complex. else, this beer seems exactly the same as before.",Negative,Positive,Negative

".33 l bottle. 2006. bottle # 22139. pours a muddy brown with a light tan head that became a dense film at about mid-glass and lasted until the end. very nice aroma of caramel, brown sugar, figs and alcohol. the flavor is initially sweet figs, caramel, and a bit of brown sugar, followed by an earthy peat flavor. some definite alcohol heat at the finish reminiscent of the finish on a sip of scotch whiskey. the heat does not interfere with the other flavors. dense, almost syrupy mouthfeel. really good - wish i had another put away!",Positive,Positive,Positive

"for this review, i have tried a bottle that has been brewed under license by carlsberg in sweden. the colour is clear yellow. the white foam dissolves quite fast into a half-finger thick layer. the smell is fresh with lots of bitter hops. uncomplicated. the taste is straightforward first, there is a clear taste of pilsenermalt that evolves into a fine, dry bitterness from the hops. the bitterness slowly dies away into a tender note of puff pastry! this is a beer that knows what to do and does it with precision. no-nonsense! carlsberg beer is known in sweden as hof , the danish word for court after the large text on the label that once informed the buyer that carlsberg is a purveyor to the danish court.",Neutral,Negative,Neutral

"tasted side by side with goose island bourbon county stout. first thoughtwhere is the bourbon? seriously, this one is so coffee dominated, i can barely pick up any alcoholic notes at all, much less bourbon. freshly ground coffee explodes into the nose, followed closely by dark and bitter chocolates, toasted caramel, and trace amounts of bourbon. a quick swirl of the opaque mahogany liquid reveals moderately thick, sugary legs that leave virtually no lacing behind. flavors of decadent dark chocolate and rich, freshly ground coffee beans are kissed by just a touch of boozy bourbon. the body is medium-full and very smooth, with a lingering coffee roast sticking to the roof of the mouth and the tongue for ages. this is a very nice brew, but is it really much better than terrapin wake-n-bake? i think not. bourbon county stout owns this beer.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"my favorite types of beers are those that don t taste like typical beer. i prefer an authentic, niche, well-crafted style even if it s not the easiest beer to drink. of course, not all beers that fall into that category are automatically masterworks, such as weihenstephaner hefe weissbier. this is a beer whose reputation precedes it, and for the most part it lives up to the hype. pour, color and aroma wheat beers tend to flow very smoothly out of the bottle, as this one did. however, trying to pour the beer itself is quite a challenge. whether poured down the side or the center of the glass, this brew forms a huge layer of fluffy, bright white, marshmallow-like head. the head lingers throughout the life of the beer and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. the complexion is a dark orange amber hue which is, not surprisingly, extremely hazy with some miniscule sediment noticeable. the aroma is potent with clove and banana and overall very sweet-smelling. taste weihenstephaner hefe weissbier has a very sweet palate which isn t quite as spicy as i would have liked. it has a strong taste of banana and clove noticeable from the first sip to the last swig. the liquid itself has a slightly grainy texture, making it drink more like a hearty beer than a gimmicky, novelty beverage. the only caveat is clove might be a bit too strong for me, as i probably would ve preferred a more intense, juice-like taste, but the overall palate here is definitely clean. finish the great thing about wheat beers like this is how much softer in the mouth they tend to be than typical lagers and ales. there is definitely no hop bite here, so this beer goes down extremely smooth. combined with the sweet taste, hefe weissbier would make a great introductory hefeweizen. body if the cloudy body is off-putting to the lightweight drinker, they should consider how easy the beer is to drink and the fact it s a very light beer. at 5.4 abv, hefe weissbier is only a little stronger than your mass-market brew, and is likely equal or even lower in calories and carbs . final thoughts a beer like weihenstephaner hefe weissbier is probably the best example of what a truly authentic german wheat beer should be. note watch the video version of this review at http www.youtube.com watch?v zd4zag20d5i",Positive,Positive,Positive

"not the biggest fan of the paulaner brewery simply from the disappointing beers from their range that i have tried, so i didn t expect too much of this one. poured an opaque, orange gold with a huge, quickly formed, dense and fluffy white crown that rose a good half inch from the stein. the head remained for the length and left glugs of drying froth down the glass as i sipped . a little burnt toffee and gritty haystack grain came through in the aroma, as did softer notes of bubblegum, banana and lemon concentrate, making for a pleasant start to the tasting. quite soft in carbonation, medium-light in body and initially creamy in mouthfeel. subtle mix of toasted malts, sweet banana and pear, and tangy lemons and grapefruit. finish is a little short, but it remained fresh and crisp for the length. served chilled this proved a decent german wheat beer, and the first paulaner beer to ignite my senses. quite nice",Positive,Positive,Positive

"original review 7 14 09. i gotta admit. i have the lowest of expectations for this beer. i wasn t even planning on trying it. this beer became the stakes of a bet between my brother and i. loser had to consume a 24oz can over the span of an hour. he lost. but feeling sort of bad for him, i told him i d try a bit to relieve his burden. here goes pours an murky pinkish red with a big 2-finger head on top. this disappears quicker than i can say tomato juice. it looks like grapefruit juice. too bad it tastes nothing like that. smells like celery and vomit. serious horridness going on here. it s like a rabbit puked in my glass after an afternoon in my garden. gross. the mouth is spritzy and bubbly. thank goodness for that. if this was mellow and flat, i would purge. at least it feels alright. flavor is of watered-down tomato soup, celery, and the faintest of grains. this is just all-out horrible. i will never, ever again allow this to get into my digestive systemunless i lose the next bet.",Negative,Negative,Negative

transfer from ba review on 3-21-12 - poured from bottle into fluted glass appearance pours a hazy yellow-orange color with a very large billowy white head. the head has really good retention and lasts for some time before giving way to a moderate level of lacing. smell the smell is very peppery in nature. a nice lemon aroma is also mixed in there with a good yeasty smell as well. taste the taste begins with a nice wheaty base infused with some lighter citrus flavors. a good presence of yeast is also detected at the forefront of the taste. a peppery flavor develops more in the middle of the taste. it lasts throughout the rest of the taste profile and in the end mixes in with a more biscuit malt body leaving a nice somewhat spicy flavor on the tongue. mouthfeel a medium bodied beer with a rather average level of carbonation. makes for an easy drinking brew which is quite appropriate for the style. overall a good brew that is easy to drink. it has some nice peppery flavors as well as some very nice aromas.,Positive,Positive,Positive

"april 2022. my amazon repeat order of leffe was out of stock so i get a box of 750ml bottles of hoegaarden instead. hmmm. even with the corriander this is an insipid beer. needs to be drunk cold with a fruit garnish on a hot sunny day to make it palatable. yes, it is drinkable, but no, it s not particularly pleasurable. 2.5 march, 2003 bottle. unfiltered. enjoyable and refreshing. the spice is less noticable in this than other witbiers i ve tried, and the slight citric edge adds a gentle and juicy tang. i would buy this again. 3.5 april 2003 keg. unfiltered. just had this on tap. o yummy! fresh and delicately fruity - the orange shines through, perfectly balanced by the gentle warmth of the spice. an absolute joy! 3.9 oct, 2004 pression. market bar, nimes. with lemon slice. salty froth. the lemon dominates to the extent that it provides most of the interest. the beer itself is simply inoffensive. 2.3 oct, 2005 bottle. one of my local pubs has celis white on tap. so i had some of that, and then a bottle of this straight after. hmmm. the hoegaarden tastes very insipid after the celis white. it also tastes very clean. it s pleasant - but lacks character. 2.6",Positive,Positive,Positive

"grace is a hard skill to acquire. it needs just enough force to perform, but enough silence to impress. hoegaarden, like its personified equivalent the gymnast, accomplishes that task. it is a graceful beer with a graceful touch, and like an accomplished spy it makes its presence known and leaves before anybody can question its intent. so, for a simple beer, the hoegaarden is difficult to touch. the visual appearance is a straightforward cloudy yellow. the shade reminds me of faded 1970 s lawn furniture, but don t let that discourage you from drinking it. the foam is thin and white and, sadly, unengaging, but i don t expect a heavy blanket on top of something like a witbier. the aroma gave me shivers at first, but that may be because my earlier experience with this type of beer was extremely disappointing. inside the smell is the obvious wheat, a complement of lemon and a slightly distracting modicum of soap. if i really stretch it i can smell sour dough bread, but i think that may be my fondness for san francisco and clam chowder speaking. most surprising to me is the duration of hoegaarden s taste. like i mentioned before, it slips in and out before i can really grasp it and pick it apart. what i do know about this sly beer, is it s an excellent drink after some exercise or a hard day of pushing papers or furniture or whatever it is you do. also, best served at colder temperatures. unlike belgian ales the taste does not improve with warmth. overall i d describe this beer as being very mild mannered and ethereal. there one moment and gone another. it s not even missed once it escapes down my esophagus, yet i can t help but come back for another sip. wily brew, this one.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"peroni is italy s largest brewer, and this is one of the most successful brands. most pasta pizza places in britain will have a nastro on the menu. brewed in rome and naples it a very dry and laid back birra with a very subtle malty sweetness. beer lover though i am, a young italian red wine is best with pasta. this, however, is just about acceptable to help you wash down a pizza when the pizza house offers nothing else. because of its light taste, the 5.2 alcohol can creep up on you.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"bottle brought out as a surprise during founders event at south philadelphia taproom. and what a surprise it was! pours pitch black with thin coffee colored head. excellent aroma which is dominated by bourbon and oak but not too much so that you cant t detect the chocolate and roasted coffee. i smelled this beer for several minutes before sampling it. this beer is very smooth considering it s complexity and abv. lots of bourbon and oak flavor, roasted coffee maltiness, vanilla, chocolate candi sugar and caramel. excellent!",Positive,Positive,Positive
"i love guinness stout! however this draught in a bottle only does one thing for me, makes it convenient. i first ordered this in a bar when it first hit the market and i thought the waitress was a real rookie when she didn t bring me a glass. she said, read the bottle. anyway, if you have a glass on hand, the can is much better and if you are at the bar, get it on draught if it s available. the other rip off is the 11.2 ounces, one night i drank 6 in about an hour when i noticed the smaller capacity bottle. it s great though that there is finally a real product called a widget ! i just love saying rocket widget !",Negative,Negative,Negative

"aroma it honestly smells like a bacon and egg breakfast w tobasco sauce to me, i don t care if this beer is mostly supposed to reflect coffee chocolate flavors, this beer truly captures the essence of my sunday breakfasts 2 eggs, sunny side up, smothered with tobasco verde sauce and black pepper, 3 strips of maple smoked bacon, two whole wheat toast w butter and cherry jelly for soaking up the yoke, strong black coffee , and a small glass of o.j yup, that s what i m reminded of when i smell this brew appearance the body is standard stout, coffee brown bordering on black, but the head is exactly as described on the bottle, a frothy cinnamon color that lingers after the pour taste strong hashbrown skillet, but also the roasty coffee and dark chocolate that this brew is known for, heavy smoke also, again, just like the aroma, the taste truly captures the essence of a breakfast palate decent bitter lingers, which helps remind you that you re drinking a beer as opposed to eating a meal overall i can honestly say that i loved this beer before my colleagues on rb took a liking to it too, so my rating is in no way influenced by its tremendous popularity, i ve been raving about this stout to my family and friends, and, except for one person who is not a fan of coffee, everyone has agreed that its either one of the best stouts they ve ever had, or its at least one of the better ones they ve had in a while, enjoy!",Positive,Positive,Positive
"2009 bottle. whoa, serious change from previous vintages. the aroma of coffee dominates everything. espresso on steroids with some melty milk chocolate dropped in. the body pours black as night with a dark brown creamy head. the intense coffee flavor really perks up my nose and opens my senses during eat sip. the body is heavy and rich with thich sweet malts, chocolate and heavy rich coffee. i am getting much less barrel than in years past but there is still that almost sour wood funk lying way in the background. i love this beer. hate the new label though oh well.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"batch 2. a careful pour yields a very lightly hazy golden-orange color. a foamy, snow white head shows fairly good retention, settling slowly to a thin layer with a solid edge. lacing is sudsy, with a few spots and patches remaining on the glass. aromas include fresh banana esters, orange peel, sweet, bready yeast, wheat, and lemony hops. some spicing is present as well, notably clove and a touch of coriander. flavors basically follow suit, though the citrus hop content is surprisingly potent. the fruity, sweet elements are well balanced by the bitter hops, as well as a spicy, peppery finish. tastes really fresh. quite drinkable, even at 8.2 . medium-plus bodied, the lively, fizzy carbonation intensifies the spiciness a good deal. overall, this is a very enjoyable brew. the primary differentiation from the brooklyn-brewed version is a heftier citrus hop billing. because of this, i d give the slight edge to the schneider-brewed version.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"pretty dark pour with a tan head. aroma of coffee and chocolate malt. flavor is of roasted malts and chocolate cafe coffee. the very balanced flavor leads to a potent palate -- initially creamy, which morphs into a lively, more interactive experience. it is very dark -- there is a minute hint of dark fruit against the dark chocolate coffee --, and its merit in being so is its exact balance. smoky with some subtle hops. very rich, very sexy .",Positive,Positive,Positive

"pours dark. very viscous in appearance alone. i would think it flat if not for the carbonation pop i heard when opening the bottle. very slight head formation, like something rising from the deep. but it never materializes and simply forms a very, very fine, tan ring on the perimeter. i d score it higher for looks but it s just black and the lack of head kinda detracts from the visual appeal. but wow does it smell great! bourbon and oak are up front. maybe plum? chocolate notes as well. very viscous in the mouth. surprisingly, more coffee and cocoa-like chocolate up front. bourbon notes more noticeable in the finish. sweet but very smooth. i like that you can smell the bourbon but not really be overwhelmed by it.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"i m not going to lie, i m pretty disappointed even though my expectations weren t that high. even by pale-lager standards this is bland, not bud light bland, but definitely blander than some of the better national, mass-produced pale lagers out there. neither the aroma nor the taste contains any trace of anything that can be ascribed to a decent malt or hop profile, and the mouthfeel is pretty standard. i couldn t finish the whole bottle. i appreciate the lack of rice or corn, but this is still pretty subpar.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"500ml bottle. the aroma on this is quite nice with hints of cereal, wheat, lemon and scant bubblegum. yeast esters are present, but not overly obnoxious or dominant. mildly hazy golden body with a medium, fizzy white head. moderate head retention. starts with a little sweet cereal flavoring. the middle has a little spritzy mineral character before some light yeast esters give off flavors of bubblegum, lemon, and cotton candy. finishes with a little more sweet maltiness. a very easy-drinking beer that s straight-forward.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"16.9 oz bottle into an aventinus glass. pours hazy amber with a medium dirty white head that collapses into a skiff of foam after a few minutes. aroma consists of banana, bubblegum, apples, caramel--not as clean and clovey as the best examples of the style. taste is sweet and meaty with a slightly tart finish. mouthfeel is a bit too bubbly for my tastes. nice enough, but i was expecting so much more.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"there s nothing to this beer, but i want to comment on the appearance. usually, a beer has a hard time messing up appearance, but this one takes the cake it has an ugly label, an ugly screw-off bottle that looks like crackly ice and the beer itself looks like someone just ran a green tea bag through it once while cold. wretched, even for a mass market brew.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"one of the good mass-produced beers out there. lives up to all the hype in my book. the appearance is a perfect dark color, with a rich creamy head that extends up quite a bit. smells fantastic, and the flavor is rich and full of depth. i find the palate to have a great aftertaste and still retains a nice stiff bite at the end. thicker, but not extremely filling. and of course, one of the best out of the can tastes there is.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"stella is great! always reliable and never on the shelf long enough for the cursed green bottle effect. poured out the usual large white rocky head the is retained just above beer level. ample messy lacing, nice bright clear gold colour. the first smell that hits is lemon followed by bready malts, grains and low floral scents. always has a faint skunk but i m used to it in this style so no biggie. taste is always refreshing but never exciting. grains, slight fruit, middle to end bready malts and average bitterness. light to light medium bodied. smoothly carbonated. goes down smooth and dry with little bit of bitter dull aftertaste. probally nearer to average than i rated it but tough titties.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"the trade off of taste for low carbs is definitely not worth it. this was one of the biggest disappointments in a beer in a long time. smells a little off, first taste is not too bad, but it fades as fast as you swallow. i find it hard to believe that ab got this one past the test market stage.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"suffered through this following a bud select. a slight improvement over the b.s. makes regular budweiser taste really good. ironically, one of the better kegger beers i ve had was a keg of busch that was poured by gravity method and served ice cold. that was in 1977 though and who knows if it was young taste buds or better beer at that time. poured yellow with a minimal head, no lacing. aroma was very mild malt. nice appearance. palate was just above water. overall i would avoid it. a nice fresh bud is a big improvement over busch. i would like to suggest augie go by a local quikie-mart and sample a 24 ouncer from time to time. it might be an eye-opener for him!",Negative,Negative,Negative

"typical dark brown color with a thin layer of tan head that dissipates to a ring leaving just a bit of spotty lacing around the glass. aroma is very boozy - its tricky to even pull the bourbon aspects out as it seems like almost pure booze. taste is more complex - some woody flavors carry through along with a bit more of a bourbon bite and your more standard stout flavors. mouthfeel is great - smooth as silk and very drinkable considering the overall intensity of the beer. may not be for everyone, but it is definitely worth trying.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"before i get into corona light, i would just like to say that i appreciate corona extra. y all can hate me for it, but i really do. that said, its little sister corona light is just not up to snuff. i will give it closer to middle marks for aroma and taste, because it at least doesn t taste bad, but having mentioned that, it doesn t taste like anything. it goes in with nothing and leaves nothing behind. like extra, and disagree if you will, it looks like a million bucks, golden, with a quickly settling head when from the bottle. in closing, the gloves are coming off here, and i will be really crass, does anyone else have the problem of not being able to get drunk off this stuff or is that just me?",Negative,Negative,Negative
"this time i m having one brewed by new zealand breweries in auckland, nz, i think this is a bit blander than the belgian version, sweet, with a slight bitter edge on the finish, better than most macro lagers, similiar to the belgian brewed stella, not too much difference.",Positive,Negative,Positive
"rbsg2005 from a keg a creamy mocha crown acts as a barrier between the air and the absolute darkness of this beer. smells is comparable to those extra-strong turkish coffees that come in the miniscule cups, ground cocoa aroma. chocolate bitterness and roasted malt and somewhat subdued alcohol makes this a very round, rich elixir that i could have sampled again and again. not as good as p ch mortel, but close.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"24 oz. can. the aroma is almost, but not quite corn. arguably malt. not much hop, perhaps a hint of grassiness. no alcohol in the vapors until a very deep inhale. clear brassy gold color with a very respectable white head. medium bodied. fizzy carbonation. instant burn. sweet, almost sticky. just holding it in my mouth had an effect on the frontal lobes. this seems designed to lay one out rapidly. the finish is a vegy, odd sweet. there might be some bitter, but the overall effect has rendered my palate to a state of questionable reliability. time for some quick rinsing.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"appearance very dark brown, with a slight fogginess murkiness. the head is a work of art, with amazingly consistent tiny beige bubbles, almost all the exact same size. close to perfect in appearance, but let down by the lack of clarity and some small particulate matter. aroma sweet dark fruits initially, mixed with some sweet malt and honey. slight unfermented wort aroma appears, and some caramelised sticky-bun type notes. taste there was a lot going on here. the same dark fruit in the aroma, but the taste is almost as if they were stewed and candied. very smooth malt and caramel, with rich juicy port torquay aspects as well. honey, brandy, grape skins, and a herbal aspect in the aftertaste. warmth from the alcohol helps boost the aftertaste, and helps offset the sweetness. well balanced bitterness. mouthfeel medium-full body with medium-low carbonation. thick and rich, but never heavy. if i had to pick any flaw, maybe a little astringent and a little too dry. overall this is probably the best beer that i have had in a long, long time. it is extremely satisfying, amazingly balanced, and just so drinkable. it is something that can truly be appreciated sip-by-sip, like a fine wine or liqueur. i am interested in seeing how this one does with some age on it.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"500 ml bottle. pours a deep somewhat cloudy gold with a white frothy head that quickly dissipates to a wispy pattern over the surface that left no lace on the sides as it was sipped. after all, wheat beers tend to be cloudy and that is just part of their character. like most wheat beers, the bottle has a layer of sediment at the bottom leading me to speculate that this beer is likely unfiltered, unpasteurized, and carbonated in the bottle. this sediment is common in german and other european beers and being unpasteurized with live yeast in there would allow the beer to really show its true colors as i see it. in my beer book, that alone will win more brownie points. the aroma is actually quite delightful fruity-malty with a hint of yeast. the carbonation is very lively yet the flavor is defiantly smooth. banana, pear, a whisper of vanilla, and a whisper of grapefruit peel all together in a fine malty bouquet ending with a creamy aftertaste followed by a subtle spicy note. no slouch for flavor. brownie points for originality.",Positive,Positive,Positive

time to rate this for real. pours a bright copper color with a creamy head at first. the head does not last as long as some other pale ales. the smell has some good maltiness which is similar to the victory hop devil. the hops are present in the smell also. the taste begins with a citrusy hopiness but then balances out well with the malts. caramel and graitfruit round out the taste resulting in an excellent pale ale. this tastes much better in a glass. i used to drink it straight out of the bottle and complain that it was too bitter. in the glass it is very good and has a few similarities to the stone ipa. great stuff.,Positive,Positive,Positive

pours from the bottle with a nice white head and cloudy orange in color. the aroma for the beer is more on the banana scent with a clove undertone to it. very light in flavor with the banana coming through more than spices with no hops. a little light on the mouth wheat feel with a slight watery feel from this bottle. overall a decent beer but i would imagine it would be much better on tap or fresh. i have had better but this is pretty decent.,Positive,Positive,Positive

"a classic, and for good reason. while i agree it tastes better poured properly from a tap, the bottle is a good secondary option. however, it loses something when poured out - listen to the bottle directions and drink it straight out. an oddly pleasing aroma leads to the single most visually appealing beer you can find, with a bitter flavour with notes of coffee and chocolate. re-rated on draught sadly, time to rerate this. as i ve gotten further and further into beer tasting and sampling almost 100 different beers i ve come to realize that guinness, while still excellent, is not the best stout. having enjoyed a st ambroise or a lion made me realize that there is much more than can be done. i still adore the pour on this one, and it s the only stout easily found out on the town, but 4.6 was far too high. i respect the black beauty, but this rating is a bit more realistic.",Positive,Positive,Positive

i ve been waiting for years for this one and it s finally here. blocking out the light like a monty burns sun blocker. black with a brown fizzy head and lots of soapy lacing. smells of cafe latte and irish cream topped with fresh prunes and sweet caramels. this has some abbery ale qualities! malts in the mouth are strong on the breads and cherries. wisps of alcohol break through but it s so marvelously coy. distinctly stout with the best characteristics of unibroue and bells and rogue all thrown in for good measure. this is altogether more pleasant than i expected. superb!,Positive,Positive,Positive
"50cl bottle. pours a golden colour, disappointingly not very cloudy, with steady bubbles and a big head. the nose has pale malt, some creaminess and not much of the usual banana. the taste has more of the same with some sweetness. the palate is medium bodied and fairly refreshing though there is a slightly cloying note. overall, this is an easy drinker but not one of the best weiss.",Positive,Positive,Positive

there is a definite citrus aroma to it with a mild touch of spicyness. it pours a cloudy honey color with a fabulous foamy and thick white head. the flavor is slightly less citrusy than the aroma and the coriander and orange peel are evident and tasty. the mouthfeel is thick and creamy and the finish lingers on with a subtle citrus hoppiness.,Positive,Positive,Positive

"bottle, courtesy of tytoanderso. a god damn black pour! about as black as any t-shirt a punk-rocker could ever find. nice big frothy brown head which slowly, but surely, tapered down. coffee seriously really stands out in the aroma. its the best part of waking up. whats the best part of this is that it doesn t smell like fuckin folgers. smells like the coffee you buy, not the coffee your wife buys. the chocolate is there in the aroma, but not very overpowering. the coffee really masks it. its definitely more present in the initial taste. there s something else there too. roasted malt? the taste of oats also becomes present when you taste it. everything is fairly balanced. which works in the beer s advantage. there s the utmost hint of a very slight carbonation which is welcomed quite fondly after seeing such a dark pour. combined it creates a somewhat smooth palate. however, i was expecting something thicker. a pretty good beer. i could definitely have this for breakfast.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"this is the mother of all pilseners. draught several notches above bottled. they got world s best hops and superior water right down the road, and unadulterated barley, too. true, they took some of the meatiness out over the years, like when white wines went the fashionable, lean route, but not as much as many others, so there is still a richness here that reminds you of how distinct a classic pilsnener could and should taste.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"reviewed 1 9 2013.11.2 oz bottle into a duvel tulip. 2010 vintage. a pours a very dark brown with good opacity due to the haziness of the yeast. huge yeast particles settle on the bottom of the glass. this features really impressive head retention for 12 - i poured it about 4 minutes ago and there s still a solid off-white colored film left on top. s the first thing i notice is huge dark fruit sweetness, along with lighter fruit esters and even some faded hops. after a while, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and chocolate will enter the picture. there s a noticeable oxidation to the aroma, giving it both a stronger fruit vibe along with an underlying soy note to it. the alcohol presence is mercurial it s about what i expected. t flavors start off with a lot of ripe cherries and wheat malt. afterwards, it shows hints of soy sauce , chocolate, ripe pear, and apple. not quite as deep, or even as intensely flavored as i expected. once it warms up, it becomes more and more boozy without really contributing much complexity, and after a while becomes even sweeter though it also becomes spicier in the finish as well. so yeah, this does have a bit of complexity and depth to it. warts and all, this is a hell of an experience - and honest to god, it s enjoyable. m at the first sip, it s just about the silkiest damn thing i ve ever put in my mouth. after a while, it becomes a bit more astringent and even boozy. combined with the carbonation, it features that subtle airy sponge cake quality to the texture. while it s hard for me to taste the alcohol, it s very easy to notice on the tongue, esophagus, and stomach - the syrupy finish doing its job to an extent. o fresh, i m sure the booze would knock my tongue out, but it s done a good job of evolving into something soft and mellowish. i seriously can t imagine how boozy this would be with only a month or two of age on it. the warmer it gets, the harsher it gets - and the less i want to drink it. worth a try, but drink cold!",Positive,Positive,Positive

"transfer from ba review on 2-22-12- poured from bottle into a snifter glass appearance the beer pours a brown mahogany color with a small creamish colored head. the head fades rather quickly leaving a decent level of lacing on the sides of the glass. smell the aroma is sweet and malty with a strong showing of an alcohol aroma. the sweeter aromas are largely stone fruit in nature with cherry, plum, and raisin all present and strong. the malty smells are a nice mix of wheat and a bready smell with the boozy alcohol aroma rounding out the sweeter and maltier smells, giving the beer a very inviting smell. taste- the taste is robust and big as would be expected for a 12 abv brew with the flavors following the nose very well. it starts with a wheaty and dark fruit flavor upfront which creates a backbone for other flavors to come and go upon. toward the middle the fruit flavors intensify some as more cherry enters the taste while a yeasty and spice flavor complement wheat taste at this time as well. along with the fruit so too comes nice flavors of caramel and toffee, which get stronger more toward the end of the taste. more toward the end and along with the caramel and toffee comes a alcohol taste. while it starts out more moderate it grows in strength more toward the end in the taste. the flavors mix and mingle on the tongue to in the end leave a very satisfyingly sweet but balanced boozy and lightly spiced flavor on the tongue. mouthfeel- the body of the brew is quite thick and creamy with a very soothing feeling on the tongue as the creamy body and lighter carbonation create a full mouthfeel. this feel is quite nice for all the rich ad boozy flavors of the brew, making for a nice sipping and warming brew. overall a somewhat obscure brewing style done very well. this is one quite tasty brew and well worth a try.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"i just have to rerate this beer because my tastes have changed so much since i first tasted it. i now enjpoy stouts a lot more than i used to. guinness is working its way up my list. its smoothness, flavor, and characteristics suite a nice irish pub scene or a cigar bar. a good beer for colder weather, as you won t see me drinking this stuff in a mid july.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"i you are in a dublin bar this the only drink to drink, outside of ireland i tend to avoid it, but when home in the dirty dublin a pint of plain is your only man. appearance when poured expertly is a thing of beauty, clerical black with a white collar, aroma is burnt hops and not anything to sing about, taste of a good pint is hard to beat, palate is unexceptional however. guinness comes in many guises but a good pint in a good pub in dublin is how it should be drunk",Positive,Negative,Positive

"incredibly sippable belgian white with a prominent note of orange peel. great introductory wheat beer for those who have yet to experience the smooth drinkability but full-bodied flavor of the style. hoegaarden s sweetness spreads across the palate like silk, and the citrus note is prominent without being ostentatious or domineering, sometimes a hazard with wheat beers. basically, it is an excellent upper-midrange wheat beer that is completely accessible, easy to come across, and fairly priced. if you can t enjoy one of these i don t think we ll be able to hang out.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"roiling columns of gooey foam makes quite a show, like a simmering vat of molasses and cocoa and everglades backwater. holding it to the sun presents some ruby filigree along the edges, but otherwise it s dark as oiled cavalry chaps. slightly metallic and peat aroma. if i m not in the mood for it, it tastes sharp and rubbery with soy notes if i m more positively receptive, i revel in the dry creaminess. either way, it s an honorable standard, tho for me, it s often purchased because it s merely the best offering at so many weenie midwest booze stores.",Positive,Positive,Positive

natural light this beer is truly awful and as cheep as it may be it is still not worth it. it tastes and smells dirty and rotten. it doesn t even have the flavors of beer in it. there is no grain malt or hops just rain water that ran through your filthy gutter on the house all cluttered with rotting leaves when it cam out of the rain spout it was put in a can an pushed on me as beer. a few sips was as much as i could handle. this is my worst beer experience. worse than another skunked beer i ve had. yet josh drank several cans and i assume that it what the crap always tastes like. i just got a weyerbacher blithering idiot and a snifter glass and sipped my one beer while he finished off the six cans. avoid. hope this is helpful. cheers!,Negative,Negative,Negative

"definitely an interesting change from your normal lagers. my second favorite weissbier . somewhat watered down when compared to weihenstephaner hefe weissbier, but for the price and availability, not a bad beer on a second try , i have become somewhat more supportive of this beer. i still think that ayinger brau-weisse is the best weissbier out there , but this one is very good as well. nice hoppy taste and great on tap--seems to have more flavor that way. on a third go-round, it s still wonderful.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"12 oz bottle generously given to me by willblake. the pour is completely black and thick, appears very syrupy. only a small brown head appears on this beer, and quickly dissipates. aroma well this beer definitely means business. a thick, strong aroma filled with chocolate, roast coffee, light notes of vanilla and a moderate bourbon-bourbon seems to get stronger as the beer is warming. taste coffee, roasted grains, chocolate, bourbon, and light notes of vanilla all make appearances. the body is very full, yet relatively smooth. all flavors blend very nicely. carbonation is soft and works very well. finishes moderately bitter and roasty. very complex, extremely well done. i ve been looking forward to trying this beer for a long time and it didn t dissapoint. thanks jon!",Positive,Positive,Positive
"rerate i love looking back and seeing i agree with what i wrote years ago. not a big syrupy imp stout, but a well balanced monster that is so easy to drink, yet lingers on the palate and tantalises the taste buds. initial glorious impy stout that shouldn t be drunk on such a glorious sunny day as today. even though scorching outside this is a glorious impy stout. in contrast to my other favourites in this genre this is more delicate and should i say it thin because it lacks that rich sugary impy goodness than most have, though it does however make up for it in how balanced this beer is. so balanced this could be my new summer beer! given the temp outside the icecream floater may have been a great option!",Positive,Positive,Positive

"the appearance of this beer fuses a black color and a tan head that dissipates quickly to leave a ring on top of the liquid, and the aroma is complex with notes of bourbon, coffee, roasted malts, and a hint of dark chocolate. the palate is more bold than the taste with its full body, long chocolatey finish, oily texture, and soft carbonation, but the taste is still an experience of a mild umami, mild sweetness, and a mild bitterness.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"poured a really hazy orange yellow with a profuse creamy white head. the nose was really citrusy, lots of sweet citrusy hops, some wheat in the background and very mild banana. the aroma profile of a wheat beer is an easy one for the hops to dominate as they do in this. the flavor is citrusy and waxy, light bitterness, mild alcohol. mouthfeel is full and smooth from the wheat, a decent amount of carbonation, and a waxy feel. finishes citrusy and bitter and then fades to wheat and banana, a little warmth comes out as well. the wheat is the most prominent in the finish.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"tasted this one years back, but it seems to have been mass market modernised now, as it didn t appear to be the same as it once was tasted from the bottle and poured into its own stumpy tumbler. pours an opaque pale wheat yellow, with a short dense and creamy head. aromas of spicy coriander, fell second to a candy sugar sweetness that was cloying prior to even the first sip. in the mouth, a smooth, lightly carbonated, pasty and yeasty palate revealed light citric zest and candy sugar sweetness, cloying and gluggy, with no lactic yeast and wheat hit or spicy balance. still, all else aside, it is oddly sessionable, though cloyingly sweet and not what i remember it as",Positive,Positive,Positive
"great for my ipad, i guess. poured at 12.1 celcius it has huge head but dissipates a little too quickly, jet black licorice body. heavy fusels, molasses, sugar mixed with motor oil on the nose, no finesse to it just brute force of sweetness and alcohol. flavour is subdued, swampwater candy with hints of chocolate. pretty good but not complex enough for its accolades.",Positive,Positive,Positive

pours black with brownish foam. neutral aroma. the taste is very cloying through the overuse of caramel malts. the alcohol is also way too strong. this beer is highly overrated and there are far better porters out there. it totally lacks the english ester profile. tastes like a beginner s homebrew. go out and buy all the dark black malts that you can find and throw them together. i am tasting it side by side with a fuller s london porter and the founders is not even in the same class.,Positive,Positive,Positive

"mgd is wimpy and mildly fizzy, the weak flavor suggests rice, light hops, corn, and yeast. this is bland, boring, cheap bar swill. this used to be considered a good beer, a real draft beer as opposed to a canned brew. hmm rerated in 2009 2011, and it seems like it got a little sweeter and cornier, and the aroma declined. fresh from the tap taste says the trademarked slogan, along with frederick miller s signature. maybe it is a little fresher than other macros, but why bother? it is not the worst, but it is pretty close. to be consumed only when nothing else is available",Negative,Negative,Negative

"pour from a 12oz bottle. clear golden brew with two fingers of head and good head retention. malty aroma - bread and caramel - with a weak floral hops and slightly metallic overtones. taste is light sweet malt - again bread with caramel overtones - with modest floral hops emerging later in the swallow. end with a very nice though restrained grassy bitter. i enjoyed kirin now and then in the 70 s and 80 s but really drifted away from it. i first reviewed it in 2009 and wondered why i ever liked it - it was skunky, adjunct laden and devoid of character. the new 100 malt formula is a huge improvement and return to the brew that i liked in the past. not to be too glowing in praise here it has risen to the level of passable mediocrity, up from being banal and marginally offensive. but let s celebrate every success 8 17 2009 pour from a 22 oz brown bottle. typical pale lager look - light yellow with two fingers of white head. slightly skunky aromoa, though checking the bottle it is well within the freshness date. not much to the aroma. not much to the flavor either - weak malts and slightly dry finish. brewed by ab, it has all the zest zing and excitement of a budweiser. which is to say - not much.",Positive,Negative,Positive

"12oz bottle courtesy of ftownthrowdown poured into a tulip. this one poured dark, dark brown out of the bottle and settles in black with hints of mahogany around the edges. an aggressive pour produces a smallish tan head that recedes to a ring quickly and leaves little lacing. the aroma is stunning on this one with everything you could ever want in a porter. it s got dark sweet malts, with lots of chocolate and hints of roasted coffee. it s also got plenty of sweet dark fruits and hints of caramel, vanilla, and even a hint of hops. one of the best aromas i ve had on a porter. the taste is only a small step behind the aroma in my book. it s definitely sweet with lots of dark chocolate malts and molasses sweetness. tastes like a dessert with a splash of coffee infusion. the mouthfeel is full-bodied with low, soft carbonation and just completely coats the mouth with the dark sweet malts. decadent mouthfeel overall, especially for the style. quite simply, one of the best porters i ve ever tasted. the nose is world-class and the taste and mouthfeel are pretty damn close. i m not sure if i ve ever had a beer with more flavor at this abv level. wonderful stuff.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"pours an opaque black with a luscious coffee head into a snifter. dissolves into a thin layer shortly after the aggressive pour. aroma is strong of coffee with some roasted malts, oak and a little earthiness. coffee plays the leading role in the flavor. the initial palate hit is of strong bitter coffee rounding into an earthy hop bitterness. presence of oak and a slight bit of vanilla i also detect. mouthfeel is good and creamy. this is a coffee stout no doubt about it. not even remotely close to too sweet. low carbonation levels and it got better as it warmed. i don t like a whole lot of alesmith brews with the exception of this. always glad when a bottle of speedway comes my way as it s way way too drinkable for a 12 big stout. it tastes better than the coffee i have every morning, but would probably get me fired from work if i make it my normal go to beverage.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"poured from a can into a pint glass. the color is a light yellow with little or no head. no lacing at all. the smell is very muted, nothing beyond so light corn flavor. the taste is light in flavor, kind of the opposite side of the spectrum from stone s brews. on the good side it does not over take your palette with too many strong flavors. if you are inexperienced with big beers this a beer that would be good to try. a good session beer and a good summer time brew.",Negative,Negative,Negative
can. i thought this would be thirst quenching refreshment after a hot day gardening. instead it was a sweet mess with lots of chemically flavours. most of it watered the plants and i hope the slugs enjoy it before their watery graves. i ve been generous with the appearance as i thought it was a fairly average looking can and the glimspe of a pale stream of liquid cascading onto the plants was fleeting at best.,Negative,Negative,Negative

"500ml bottle. pours a cloudy caramel brown, with an off-white head. most of the usual hefe-weisse aromas. banana, dough, cloves and caramel, with the resiny, peachy citrus aroma of hops very much present. literally smells like a blend of hefe-weisse and ipa. my two favourite things combined. big ipa resinous, soapy hops out of the gate, which kind of overpower the hefe-weisse characteristics. the hefe-weisse is there, but it s all in the finish. faint citrus, yeast, and banana with a sweet citrus hop finish. this is some exciting stuff, and well worth the money.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"typical, but loverly, cloudy orange body with snow white head. quite some yeast sediment. nose is immediately hoppy with lots of floral notes, spruce together with dough and banana. nice, full bodied texture giving rise to a somewhat sweet weisse taste, much more fruity than their original version. the hop-twist makes it interesting but it does misses out on the spices a little for me. solid drink nonetheless.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"so you are saying, he has tasted this before correct. i just didn t want to rate from memory. not a ticker, drink as i rate. let s find out why this is referred to as nasty light at times by my daughter. silver 12 oz pop top can with blue and red letters. no plastic slug inside, after all it is brewed for a naturally smooth taste. color is regular old pale yellow as with any typical pale yellow american beer. very little white head that fades rapidly and it has some carbonation rising here and there in the form of single bubbles. no aroma to speak of can be detected. beer flavor of course and there is little there as far as personality goes. this is a non offensive brew that can be easy to consume. after each sip there are a few streams of bubbles that arise in the glass. typical lager beer impressions but may have an interesting industrial background hint that sets it apart. it is definitely in the finish, too. no offensiveness in the finish but that refined odd hint hangs for about a minute. if you chug this you are missing out on what typical pale yellow american beer is all about!",Negative,Negative,Negative

"pours motor oil black with a thick luscious milk chocolate head that quickly fades into a golden mocha foam. beautiful looking beer. aroma is of strong coffee and slighty sweet malts. the taste is very strong, typical of an imperial stout. tastes as if they added alot of coffee as they imply. hmmm, still a really food stout, not my favorite though. if you like imperials though, or stouts in general this beer is for you.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"schneider sohn might very well be the best classic hefeweiss bier brewer in the world. the brooklyn brewery has this energy to push a beer over the edge. side-by-side, they are virtualy invisible. this ber-weizen hopfen-weisse represents the classic weizen, pushed to the limit by the american way of brewing beer. it s everything from m nchen to the red hook. herbal-hoppiness, banana-fruity, dough-yesty, classic clove and bubble gum and a little american citrus taste. it s the beastie boys live in theresienwiese",Positive,Positive,Positive
"bottle. clear gold with a bubbly, white head. sharp and sweet light aroma, of hops, malt, and yeast, with a hint of citrus. taste is quite sweet, of malt, with a hint of sharp, bitter hops. lingering sharpness that fades almost immediately. for a crappy light beer, it is better than most crappy, light beers.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"well, i have been sitting on this guy long enough, i figured it was time to give it a shot. heck, afc-nfc championship weekend only comes around once a year. i popped the bottle and poured her in my tulip glass. this beer pours jet black with a fluffy tan head. sweet chocolate, coffee aroma filled my kitchen as i poured this bad boy. sat down on my couch and sipped her slowly. flavor is big chocolate and coffee, with a long lasting bitter hop taste. hop kick reminds me of some storm king. but this beauty is more thick and syrupy than storm king. so, i finish my first glass, the rest is on the kitchen counter. my dumbass cat decides to sit on me when i have an empty glass. i hate to push her off me when she plunks down on me like that, but damn, i had some speedway stout on the kitchen counter. so she got the boot fairly quickly. anyway, this beer gives storm king a run for being the best impy stout out there, imo. its more thick, so it may be better, but storm king is more affordable. eh--- they are both fantastic.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"spots a nice clear shimmery yellow. good malt and hops fragrances. very nice level of carbonation. i appreciate tha fact that the maltiness stands out eventhough it s a light body beer. the low degree of hops bitterness allows the sweetness in the brew to come forward. crisp and clean, it s easy on the palate. highly refreshing uncomplicated pale lager. do note that whereas this beer has a simple taste, it does not lack character. the various aspects to this lager are well balanced and, the interplay is neat.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"aroma absolutely screams drink me! smoky, oily, with strong notes of roast malt, quality coffee, chocolate and molasses, it demands that you take more than a mere taste. it pours an oily black sable that could hide in the folds of darth vader s cape, with a firm and fine-bubbled tan head that hangs around for a while. smoky flavor has firm tones of top-shelf malt and chocolate - you d think they had tossed hershey bars into the mash tun. subtle notes and hints of quality coffee, molasses and caramel sneak through. sweetness is not too strong - this ain t no dessert beer. firm, smooth, somewhat oily texture has a good amount of fizz and leaves a smoky, chocolaty, lip-smacking finish. nar this whal when you can! d",Positive,Positive,Positive

"rated first time 8.01.2007, last time february 2008 on tap at old central pub in sosnowiec, poland nitro can on tap, extract of wort 9-10 to face the truth i had not many dry stouts in my life and as that one has no aspect that could leave me unsatisfied, it doesn t already mean that it is the best in the world. probably the most commercialized and the most popular one, and all of us knew there is no big deal about describing here what guiness is like and what s the taste - everybody knows it. it tastes exactly like guiness . trully i like it and have nothing against it. in fact i enjoy it very much. the thing that i became aware of thanks to looking at a beercart iat pub is its quite low wort extract that is really felt as the beer is not as essential as i would possibly expect. it is a kind of wattery ash-tray like burned and roasty. its good for me becouse i m a big fun of coffee and all coffee reminding products will fit me too. still i think there are more dry dry stouts than guiness. it is not that dry but bitter on the other hand. all in all guiness will always be in tight top among dry stouts.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"i can t believe i am only just now rating bud. well, there isn t much to say that others haven t. it s a light golden with a thin white head. i really can t smell anything. taste is grainy, a little grassy and just a little hoppy. not very good at all, but then againto all the hatersthere are some really bad beers out there. this one is only mediocre. really pretty decent for working on the car, mowing the lawn, etc.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"pours chestnut. terrific beight head, with good retention and considerable lace. aroma-wise, this one is boozy like there s not tomorrow. otherwise, it s all about the cereals and the yeast. this said, i had a cold, so i can t say much more. taste is grapes and banana galore! some clove as well. less boozy than what aroma would suggest, but still boozy. to a certain extent, it really tastes like a boozier aventinus, only with a bigger emphasis on the dark fruits and a lesser emphasis on banana. not much in the way of hops. sticky mouthfeel, perfect sugar balance, which is impressive considering how low on hops this one is. yeast job? maybe. finale is rather long, but smooth. all in all, this one is not as good overall as the aventinus. but, as a winter warmer, it s as good as it can possibly get.",Positive,Positive,Positive
pours a bright hazy golden orange with a huge fluffy white head that lingers for most of the session as the bubbles continually regenerate the head. the lacing is delicate and minimal. the smell is big and spicy with huge german hops with a sweetness of bananas and cloves. this is all on top of the sweet wheat and yeast base that pervades the aroma. the taste follows the aroma and has the big wheat base that has abundant spices and lemon zest thrown in. the mouthfeel is medium and creamy with huge carbonation. drinkability is extremely high on this one and it makes for an excellent summer brew.,Positive,Positive,Positive

pale yellow color. what can i say about this beer? it s just terrible that s all. i ve never enjoyed this beer the only reason i ve drank it in the past was because i didn t have money for anything else. so if you re completely broke and don t have taste buds then this is the beer for you.,Negative,Negative,Negative

"had this over the weekend on tap at a bar. i was first happy they had a hefe-weizen, then really happy when i tasted this beer. so smooth and delicious.",Positive,Positive,Positive
this is a great beer. this is about the amount of bourbon i like. the bourbon is only a hint and is mixed with other flavors. if you want a more bourbon taste try goose islands offer or bourbon! the goose island offering seems like bourbon was just poured into it after the fact rather than it being aged in bourbon barrels like this fine brew has. this is the best mix for my tastes. coffee is the overwhelming taste here and it is all the better for it. alcohol bourbon is not apparent so don t let that scare you away. i can t begin to tell you how well this brew is crafted.,Positive,Positive,Positive

"on the nose is molasses, vanilla and vodka. the look is like i would expectdark with a head that melts into the glass within a few minutes leaving plenty of lacing after each sip. taste is a lot of booze that is in your face and the 12 abv is prevalent enough to warm up the tongue. on the palate the carbonation assaults the tongue on contact. it s good but now that i ve had it once was enough. a 12 oz pour of this one was too much for a beer that doesn t hide the abv s.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"bottle form pick n save. here is a beer with an ego. pours bright yellow with disappearing head. hop nose up front, very mild malt taste. while refreshing, it s hype has more foam than it s actual head. grolsch is similar and better and costs about a buck less a sixer here, for that extra buck you get the paper collar around the bottle cap - a roman collar, if you will, for something less than priestly from belgium. belgium has some great beers - this is not one of them! save money and opt for grolsch or a good german lager. you want a lager from belgium? watch an old audrey hepburn movie! prosit!",Negative,Negative,Negative

"i drank this one fine afternoon from a natural tap protruding from the rockies in colorado, the only way to drink it. preferably, a train smashed outward from within a great rock face, leaving this magnanimous beer pouring out from its innards for all survivors to consume. that is, if you survive the massive avalanche that is blown upon. if you do manage to survive, straight out the mountain is much better than the can at least you don t have to check the scientific cold-o-meter on the can to tell if its reached its optimal temperature- you already know it has! ice cold! just kidding. this would literally be the last beer i would drink on earth.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"my bottom line oatmeal, roasted barley and dark chocolate build a smooth, rich body for this imperial stout nuanced by black grapes and grassy hop surges. further personal perceptions -a ring of foam settles atop the darkness. -the cereal profile in this one is really compelling. -the mouthfeel is rich, nearly viscous. -alcohol never gets in the way. there are lots of residual sugars to cover it anyway. -this one may lack complexity, but it more than makes for it in sheer malt pleasure. -the finish may be balanced , but the rest is a malt lover s affair. -the aftertaste is taken over by lengthy roastiness bottle.",Positive,Positive,Positive

great porter. chocolate and rosted malty flavor. pours pitch black with a nice brown head.,Positive,Positive,Positive
on draft at baton rouge. arguably the most beautiful beer in the world with its jet black body and perfectly shaped mocha head. aromas are slightly underwhelming with some roasted malts and hints of coffee. tastes are pretty much in line with the aroma. nice dryness on the finish. mouthfeel is incredibly creamy. overall there is a reason this is one of the world s most recognizable beers and it s the quality of every draft of this i ve ever had.,Positive,Positive,Positive

"beware beer in clear bottles , this one should have a warning sign on its label reading do not consume . it s beers like this one that make buying micro-brewed beers so much worth while. pours a clear pale gold with a thin, quickly dissipating head of white foam. looked like creaming soda in the glass. tinny, wet dog and mineral-like nose with an odd hint of chaff. seems you have to knock it back quickly with your fingers clenched firmly over your nose as the aroma follows straight through into the mouth. soft in carbonation, slightly sour and slick as butter cardboard malt, rice starch and maize, and lifeless stale hops all combat each other to see who could turn my stomach first. finish had some crispness cold, but it soon got nasty as it began to warm, and it was honestly hard to finish by that time. to be drunk quickly, chilled and straight from the bottle. best avoided!",Negative,Negative,Negative
"slight hazy pale yellow hue, with an off-white head, yeasty, bananaish, citrus, herbal root nose, with a hint of spicy ginger root, ripe apple fruitiness in the aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a yeasty, fruity, spicy, banana character, with a kind of apple juice fruitiness, with some hints of vanilla, ginger root and aromatic herbs, maybe eldelweiss and gentian flowers, leading towards a spicy kind of cinnamon finish.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"erdinger dunkel is one of my favorite brews so i can t wait to try this one, erdinger hefe-weizen. i was pleasantly surprised that it was no more costly than all the other brews in my beer store. the cost was just 2 for a brown 11.2 oz bottle. gently pouring the beer into my mug, it first looks like any other ubiquitous clear pale yellow american beer. then comes the aesthetic impression near the bottom of the pour the yeast starts to make its appearance. swirling, hypnotizing clouds and particles of yeast. now the brew is cloudy like i expect from a good hefe. the aroma is that of uncooked bread dough and citrus, perhaps lemons. no head on this brew but there is a constant stream of rising carbonation from within the brew. the commencement on the tongue is pleasurable, it is well behaved and nonoffensive. beautiful above average carbonation greets the back of your throat. the taste is much better than troegs dream weaver and penns weizen. very little if any bitterness can be detected in this smooth tasting brew. not much similarity to the american lager, tho very gentlemanlike in its flavors. after many drinks, i think i am beginning to detect just an ever so slight mild linger. very good and very nice, everybody should have a chance to taste this at least once. has the personality of an orval with a hefe flavor and personality.",Positive,Positive,Positive

to be honest i expecting some more things from this beer despite is an ok beer overall first of all you must have back in your mind what you want from some beers this beer has one style and it means must be one light and refreshing beer and like that you must judge the beers i think anyway the aroma remind me very hard heineken and that wasen t good sign but the taste was little different and that save the whole thing i see outside some badass japanese writings and you can t imagine this beer can be in the same level like the heineken and amstel the taste is little sour and very bitter and i m not fan for that but in this specific case the taste wasen t so bad is really dry beer and that perhaps make it little more unique for some others similar beers the beer punch you little more than usual and this difference matters for me she say you i m here in every draught and when it become little more warmer still this beer is punchy in your palate also i feel some rice here and the aftertaste is little metallic but don t affect me so much that i enjoy the aftertaste overall is a decent and refreshing lager is not one pleasand and sweet beer is really dry and punchy and that make it more unique for me i really enjoy this beer despite i expecting some more things,Negative,Negative,Negative

"free samples at the l.c.b.o so it was worth the price, but barely. chemical aroma followed by flavourless carbonation and no aftertaste to speak of. it s been a while since i swilled anything by labatts, so i was surprised at how bad it was. have they replaced all their brewmasters with marketing geniuses? call it alcopop, but don t call this beer.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"pours completely black with a frothy mocha colored head that left rings and patches of sticky lace. nose is bold espresso coffee, unsweetened chocolate , a hint of prune, licorice and a bit of alcohol. the alcohol smells solvent and detracts from the nose. there is blackened malt character on the nose with a hint of smoke. the drink is syrupy. first thing you notice is that the body of the beer is thin and has a slick mouthfeel. the alcohol is prominent on the palate. the malt is black and roasted to perfection. dry, bitter and not burnt. the coffee and the chocolate are smooth but neither of those is sweet. i kept waiting for caramel or molasses and it did sweeten on the nose as it warmed so that made the alcohol seem less bitter. i also lost the fruits i observed on the nose and this one could have used some raisin or some dried dark fruits. that kept the taste very bitter also. finished dry and with some alcohol dryness too.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a pale yellow with minimal head. i m not much of a pilsner fan to begin with, and this didn t work hard to change my mind. i ll put this in the same category as other light bodied beers. not a lot of taste and other qualities we normally rate, but oklay for having a couple cold beers by the pool on a hot summer day.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"dark brown with the signature, nitrogen-infused, tan head. smells of coffee and toast tastes of coffee and toast with that little something bitter and tart. incredibly light body and low caloric content devoid of the unburnt malty sweetness typical of normal stouts. very drinkable and delicious but so often over-priced. update i m very impressed with the head retention , and i ve just noticed for the first time a bit of light fruitiness, almost like berries, that is perhaps a subtle note from the yeast that comes out at warmer temps. cool!",Positive,Positive,Positive

"although a far superior beer, in it s own way guinness is just as overrated as it s overseas arch-nemesis, budweiser. i say this primarily due to the wealth of superior stouts which can readily be found in the us and the uk. guinness gets high marks with your average drinker based on it s subtlety, neither the bouquet nor the mouthfeel evincing much beyond the roasted coffee taste of the malt and the sweet but flat aftertaste. goes down easy but so does natural light. guinness draught is once again a better beer than the american macros i m facilely comparing it to, but i feel this is due more to the superiority of the stout genre, or rather the increased difficulty of watering a stout down to pure swill. i used to drink quite a bit of guinness in my nascent days of conneisseurism but these days, with a little more experience under my belt, i can t think of many stouts that i wouldn t just as soon imbibe as a guinness. the thick body is pleasant enough but is offset by the low alcohol content and too-subtle taste, and in fact makes guinness one of the more filling beers if, in fact, one is trying to drink enough to work up a buzz.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"pours a medium pinkish orange with a tiny ring of a head that immediately fades, lots of pink tiny tiny black particulates floating around, not at all appetising. aroma is well, clamato and pepper, lime and a little cheesiness. flavor is again, just as the commercial description, throw in a bunch of salt and some extra acidity, highly vegetal in the finish. palate is full bodied, viscous, slightly chunky, and acidic, a tiny bit of black pepper heat in there as well. really not at all appealing beer-wise, but no the worst thing in the world.",Negative,Positive,Negative

"appearance opaque black body with no red whatsoever. forms a thick, brown, creamy frothy head which retains very well and leaves pretty lacing on the glass throughout. smell roasted barley, dairy, a hint of alcohol. smell seems to indicate it will be a bitter, dry beer. taste i wish all porters were as flavorful as founders! this is that rare beer that is hearty and robust and still manages to retain the qualities of a porter. the palate is, for lack of a better decription, typical porter with the toasted malt, a milky dairy sweetness across the middle, and slight milk chocolate on the finish. it s not a particularly bitter or dry beer as is common with stouts, so there is next to no coffee flavor or bitterness here. the finish is surprisingly clean, with a hint of confectionary sweetness . mouthfeel silky smooth and soft. it doesn t coat the entire mouth the way an imperial stout would, but definitely covers the tongue from start to finish. drinkability while not the tastiest beer i ve ever had, founders porter is one of the most quaffable. between the flavorful, but tame palate, gentle mouthfeel and smooth finish it s difficult to not throw this beer down as if it were a shot. it s a fun beer to savor. the 6.5 abv feels right, but might be a tad higher than would be preferred from a porter as i would love to session this but think i d get overwhelmed quickly. overall, the best porter i ve ever had and an excellent beer in its own right. note watch the video version of this review at http www.youtube.com watch?v mgtktvfrdxc",Positive,Positive,Positive

"was hard to pour this one, as the head was big and didn t want to drop. but i m not complaining, that much. pours cloudy as expected, big white head. bits of banana, bubble-gum, and cloves right up front. sweet banana, with some clove. a little of the bubble-gum on the back-end. bit wheaty, with a typical remnant of yeast coming through. very smooth. creamy. a little sweetness stays with you along with a slight yeast aftertaste. the carbonation helps keep everything balanced. very drinkable. not much for a session beer for me, as the typical hefe flavors get to be too much over a long drinking session. but very good on a warm day.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"german wheat beers dominate. they have perfected them. paulaner might be the best. it s a conservative wheat beer, that tastes perfect. others have a slightly wilder wheat taste. so start with paulaner. can only get it in the bottle around ne ohio. but it s widely available, which is nice. far better than any belgian or american wannabe. they have been doing it a long time. for example, the equally great german wheat beer by wenstaphaner has been brewing beer since the year 1080. it s has a nice wilder wheat taste, and is available on tap at the winking lizard restaurant in peninsila, ohio. other german hefe-weizen wheat beers like schnieder, franzanhaner, ayinger are very good too. franzenhaner is on tap at the firehouse grill in cuyahoga falls, ohio. the only amercan wheat beer that comes close is victory s wheat beer. got it on tap at the gastropub in hudson, ohio 7 2014. on rt 303 just east of the low railroad bridge. enjoy !",Positive,Positive,Positive
"this is a wonderful after-dinner stout made for sipping. appealing opaque black pour with minimal tan head. aroma of coffee and roasted malts as you d expect. the flavor is thick with coffee, roasted and burnt malts with a hint of licorice and a slight hint of caramel all balanced with a bitterness at the end. but the highlight is the palate. full body and velvet smooth on the downpour. the alcohol is not overpowering, but does warm you.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"a pitch black color, opaque, with a dark caramel colored head that forms slightly and dissolves away quickly. the scent in a word, damn! there is alot coming out when smelling this beer. it starts with a combination of chocolate and coffee fragrances, and it blends itself to a sweet oatmeal scent. the taste is well blended flavor of chocolate, then to coffee, and fianlly to the oatmeal, with slight touch of bitterness at the end. a rich feel, yet very smooth, light syrupy texture at the back, it does have very nice dry finish. man, this is an excellent stout, an intense aroma, very strong flavor and a wonderful mouthfeel, make this a very drinkable beer.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"there is no shedding light that lends itself to him after weeks in the dank cavernous depths, scraping his way back to the one he loves. his beard has caught the decaying flesh of unknown species he has forced to eat, for sustenance here is hard to find. he has become one with the dankness, ready to succumb to it, until he smells the familiar burning oak of his forest, his cabin that he seeks. at first faint, the moonlight becomes apparent, as he has somehow found his way back to where he has started. woodsmoke heavy now, he rolls up his sleeves and walks to the front door. a bottle awaits. a viscous black rolls silently into his glass as he breathes in the molasses. the first sip s citrus surprise tickles, but this sensation does not return. his tongue senses a cardboard hardiness followed by a residual tonguefeel that soothes and coats his throat. it reminds him of just-skilleted butter atop baked sweetbread. looking at his glass, any previous signs of lacing have vanished like the memories of his purgatory in the cave. he sleeps a long, hibernate respite.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"so you ve had some great imperial stouts, and wonder whether this one, rated number 11 or 12 in the world, and costing a few quid, is really any better. well, it doesn t do anything particularly differently to the other great stouts. but it does do what it does extremely well. black as pitch, covering of coffee coloured head. on the surface - body is thick and creamy, aroma is coffee and chocolate, flavour has nice toasty malts, and it s very drinkable given the big big alcohol content. but give it time and explore a bit and there is a lot more to come. leave it rolling in the mouth, and the carbonation starts to tingle a bit, leaving a frothy feel. get your nose nice and close for a few seconds, and you get nuts, dried fruit, soy, wood and whisky notes. hold it in the mouth for a while, and fruit flavours push themselves over the cocoa powder - dark fruits, berries and a touch of cherry. so, if you don t want to analyse too much, it s a ridiculously tasty beer given that it s powered by 12 of the bad stuff. dig a bit deeper, and there are plenty of subtexts to enjoy.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"c mon people, this beer really deserves some higher overall ratings. poured a cool engraved green 330ml bottle into a nucleated pint glass. nice golden-amber color with fluffy white foam which subsided but left a little lace. overall fairly neutral, but faint aromas of mild malt, freshly cut grains, white bread and pronounced flowery, delicately peppery and musky hops. like heineken but crisper more refined like stella, but better yet. despite the green bottle and being shipped across the atlantic ocean, no oxidation or spoilage problems. lasting evidence of superior danish brewing science. nice subdued and balanced flavor, just a little malt sweetness and hops bitterness. no obvious adjunct faults. light body, spritzy carbonation, refreshingly dry finish. probably the world s best lager ? probably not, but a damn good one, and one of my category favorites. recommended over any american macro.",Positive,Positive,Positive

0.5l bottle into weizen glass. pours cloudy orange with a smaller #40off white #41 head than most wheat beers. the prominent aroma is tangerines with caramel wheat malts and alcohol in the background. sweet tangerines are again dominant on the tongue with touches of lemon citrus and spicy hops. the alcoholic presence comes through at the end. it is medium to full bodied with a rather sticky texture. certainly an unusual take on the style #40shouldn t a weizen bock be dark? #41 but it is still largely successful in my opinion.,Positive,Positive,Positive
"from bottle into shaker pint. pours a near black color with a finger of tan creamy head. smells like an iced coffee. taste follows nose with a cold watery cappuccino flavor. smooth creamy mouthfeel but not as good as draft or the widget can for that matter. i would not turn one down, especially on st patrick s day. a definite classic but not my go to stout by any means.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"i think i might ve purchased an old pack due to the total lack of date on the bottle, some weird indecipherable code. it been a while since i had this so i have no comparison for the current 6 pack but it seems a bit old. aroma is grapefruit with caramel malts and a bit of pine. appearance is amber with an off white head. taste is sweet and well balanced but a bit tempered and wet. palate is medium bodied and refreshing enough. a champion of a style i m not particularly fond of but certainly worth picking up in a desperate situation.",Negative,Positive,Negative

"oh boy, the old beeswax about by mistake the beer got frozen . see kulmbacher eisbock, et. al for more of this. anyway, i do prefer the kulmbacher version to this one, which suffers from a bit more heat from the alcohol and a slight and unwanted taste of cloves. the kulmbacher is a barley brew and the schneider is a weisse, probably accounting for its mild deficiencies in the strong beer category. from our flowery friends at ba, i offer another expert judgement caramel sweetbuns with toffee topping mixed with alcohol spice fruit cake makes a medium strength and very alluring aroma. bright taste with all the elements of the aroma present. some nice fruitiness mixes in as well, at times i get prune, plum, cherry, dates, as well as some really pleasant herbal bitter teases that tie it all together. so sweet.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"deep, hazy gold. sticky, off-white head settles pretty quickly to a solid half inch, and stays through the pint, leaving nice lacing. banana ester is quite strong in this bottle, with a hearty kick of clove. it does not make a pleasant combination with the abundant, somewhat aggressive hops. sweet malt enters the mix, and does not help the situation. on the thin side of medium in the mouth. the hops and spicy wheat are in control here, though the clove makes itself known in the long finish. good slightly sweet malt in there as well. a bit hot to boot. definitely tastes better than it smells. carbonation is appropriate for a weizen, with the abundant bubbles doing a fine palate-scrubbing job here. full points for originality here, but i just don t like this. it s virtually undrinkable for me.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"nicely hazy tangerine, big layer of soft white head. soft rounded spice. cloves, warm banana bread. just a touch of butter on that banana bread. to my nose, the phenolic character in a weiss can get overbearing really easily, but this is the model of restraint. sparkely, slighty tart flavor, fresh yeasty bread. the gentle tartness keeps things refreshing and bright, even lacking a perceptible hop contribution. refreshing enough for summer, enough character that it doesn t feel out of place in the middle of winter either.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"50 cl bottle from the lcbo, served in a weizen glass. pours cloudy orange-golden with a modest white head. the head fades slowly to a bare cover, leaving minimal lace. the nose has a surprising hoppy bite, with pine and citrus. there is also a significant yeasty quality, with banana and spice, but this takes a back seat to the hops. the flavor is very rich, starting out with a complex sweetness but becoming progressively more bitter towards the end. there is a prominent acidic quality, probably from the hops. the finish is long and hoppy, imparting a parting shot of bitter. on the palate, it is medium-full in body with a creamy texture and average carbonation. this is a very nice beer and quite unique. it is basically a dark hefe with a strong american hop accent. i was slightly surprised that this combination worked out. it is quite strong, not the kind of brew you want to have on a hot summer s afternoon, but very nice as a fall or winter warmer. 2010-12-10",Positive,Positive,Positive

on tap into a frosted pint glass with an orange wedge squeezed into the beer and set aside. aroma was spicy cloves with a hint of citrus. appearance was a hazy orangy gold. taste was heavy on cloves but had a subtle banana flavor. with the orange added there was a nice citrus layer added to the palate on top of the original clove and bananas.,Positive,Positive,Positive
"bottled december 2010, so almost one year of age. pours a beautiful dark amber with a small tanned rim of head. aroma is just prunes and banana all over the place. really rich plum and prune, a yeasty component of banana and fruity esters. also raisins and dark bread, slight caramel, too. very similar to port wine, due to the focus on dark fruits. taste is very similar. very full bodied, huge mouthfeel. huge sweetness, lots of plums, raisins, also bready notes and caramel. but the taste has quite some alcohol, which makes the palate somewhat rough. it does taste good, but any day, i would prefer regular aventinus.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"bottle 500ml. clear medium yellow color with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white head. aroma is moderate malty, grain, toasted. flavor is moderate sweet and light light bitter with a average duration. body is light to medium, texture is watery, carbonation is soft. 20101102",Positive,Positive,Positive
"a bit dullish blonde sort of colour. the aroma is quite fruity, apricots, mint, grapefruit and some tropical accents. fairly bitter, in that snpa sort of way, with a decent malt base. the hops aren t as bright on the palate as they are on the aroma, but that s the way for this classic 80s 90s apa. the bigger issue for me is the clunky dull thud of the malts, just some heavy-handed crystal, not a lot of positive pale malt sweetness and none of it complements the hops much. all told, there s some positive elements here, but it lacks the bright expression of a modern pale ale.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"bottle from alko. black with xl not lasting head. strong coffee, dark berries. vanilla. strong alcohol bite from start. quite fizzy.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"pours black with a slight nut brown hue in the edges with a nice light brown head. aroma is full of well-rounded roast, liquorice, almost vanilla, doughy yeast notes, notes of coffee and slight vegetal. taste has a lot of liquorice and still well-rounded roast. cocoa, coffee, almonds and bready malts. still a vegetal notes. quite a large hop presence as well, bitter in the after taste. carbonation is high, but it suites the beer well. a really good porter!",Positive,Positive,Positive
"heineken neither scores points for aroma nor appearance, but taste is solidly better than most of the american standards that try to imitate it .it has a strong initial alcohol mouthfeel, with a mild wheaty aftertaste. it s better than most of the folks on this site will have you believe, but not by much.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"didn t have many choices in the middle of rural sd so i ordered a couple. only positive i can say about it is i think it s a small notch above miller bud coors. got some grainy funk that s not off-putting, but overall just an incredibly tasteless, watered down version of a beer.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"drinking other barrel aged beers made me appreciate this more and understand the role that the increased ibu s play in overalll balance. just an amazing beer. aroma is everchanging with toffee, coffee, bourbon, vanilla chocolate just a different one all the time. taste is just as dynamic. appearance is simple, it s black as oil. light sweetness, lightly bitter, just balanced with soooo much flavor. you must taste it. i understand why people go out of their way to but this even at the high and deserved price. an experience. this year was just so vivid with chocolate and coffee. no booze evident. amazing. even better than i remembered.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"500ml bottle, 7.7 a v pours a cloudy light gold, very obviously a wheat beer. the head is rocky and amazingly pretty. aroma is also fairly typical for a wheat brew, spices, a bit of banana and orange, nothing at all tells you this is nearly 8 from the nose. taste is initially very wheaty and smooth but quickly turns into a nice deep malty palate with a lingering taste of alcohol and going down warm! there is almost a bit of a disconnect between appearance and smell compared to the taste and palate. very intriguing and a great fall winter sipper",Positive,Positive,Positive
"pours cloudy and bright orange yellow. almost looks like orange juice. aroma is bursting with citrus and tropical fruits and is typical tg. taste is absolutely amazing and juicy. full of orange, peach, mango, and pineapple. been wanting to try this for a while and reeceg came through for me. absolutely superb.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"aaarrgh poison in a can i cant stress enough how bad this beer was. my girlfriends sister recently got married and one of her new husband s old college buddies brought a case of this to the reception as some sort of nostalgic thing. i didnt understand it. but i figured i d try it since i never had it and was offered the beast . after two of them it felt, no joke, like someone was dragging razor blades across my kidneys. it tasted like used auto coolant mixed with toilet water with the most horrid slimy mouthfeel. i almost vomited trying to put this death in a can down. stay away at all costs. i dont care how cheap it is, its not even worth a penny. if i could give this beer a score of 0 i would.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"pours a very dark brown with a creamy one inch head that rises up out of the beer nice aroma of coffee and roasted malts. thin consistency. strongest taste is of coffee, not much else in fact. maybe a couple sweet notes in the beginning and little dryness towards the end. hardly any carbonation. doesn t have the body of a stout i d love.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"dark brown color, small beige head, no resistance. malty, sweet aroma, some fruit, with alcohol feeling. also alcohol feeling on taste, but with addition of sweetness and lasting fruity feeling. really nice balanced, but because of combination malts and fruits with higher abv it is not for everyone taste. i am delighted. moderate body, medium carbonation. do not drink more than one for full pleasure.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"blehpours clear very pale yellow with a big white head. aroma is a little bready with some hops. mouthfeel is kind of pebbly, thin but actually a little more heft than alot of pale lagers. lots of ugly, foamy lacing - looks kind of like a rash. flavor is some corn-like sweetness and some unappealing, biting bitterness. some hints of bread in warmer samples. did not like although i was surprised there was no skunkiness . one of those you just want to get through.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"this hefe weizen poured a hazy amber color with a full head and nice lace. the head diminished quickly, but the carbonation kept coming to give it a fresh bite throughout. it has a fruity smell , yet tastes more citrus. the taste was smooth with a biting finish. this hefe weizen is refreshing and lively.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"poured from a 500ml bottle into a tall tulip weiss glass a pours a gorgeous hazy, tawny, gold, with a huge rocky white head, which in turn seems to last forever a day. i think i could take a nap on this beer s head. throughout the beer, it leaves behind huge chunks of lacing that remind me of the archipelegos. s yeast is right there in your face, lots of cloves, bubblegum and a slight tart lemony scent are all present too. some nice fresh-baked bread brings it all together, this is an amazing smelling beer. t m sweetness hits the tip of the tongue immediately, but not cloyingly so. followed by a very creamy, almost buttery body and some nice citric bite. loads of bready malt cereal grain flavors combine with the tanginess of the wheat and lead to a enjoyably astringent finish. a delicious beer that often winds up being gulped and not sipped. d one of the all-time greats, probably the wheat beer that all others are measured against. one of the most drinkable beers around.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"pours a pale, clear gold with lots of visible carbonation and a white head. pale malts, grass, some sugary sweetness, maybe a little hay. not much to it. straightforward light american lager. andnot a badly constructed one at that. it isn t interesting, but it isn t one of the worst beers around.",Negative,Negative,Negative

this brune pours like a tawny port! the nose is toasty and smells of black coffee with faint sweet raisin! the sweetish palate reveals a rather spicy mid-palate with both toasty and black coffee characters showing up once again. the bittersweet finish is persistent. somewhat similar to a stout!,Positive,Positive,Positive

"while this is certainly not a good beer, it is one of the few that will pass in a pinch. clear, light yellow, not a whole lot of aroma. a tad of hops and malt flavor and not too citric or carbonated. if you happen to be in a bar that doesn t have and good beers order thin one. you ll at least be able to make it to the bathroom before you vomit.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"pours dark black and thick with a thin chocolate brown head. aromas of oatmeal bread, chocolate, coffee and raisins, not overpowering. bready chocolate flavor with a great roasty taste that rises into your nose from the back of your throat. strong coffee-bitter finish coats the back of your tounge. full, oily body. not sure i d want it for breakfast, but was perfect for an after dinner dessert. thanks to eyedrinkale for the in-person trade.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"being the original has its advantages , however pilsener urquell doesn t need the advantages. it is simply the best pilsener on the planet, apart from its lineage. its deep golden color is unique in pilseners, as is its maltiness and sublimely spicy bouquet of saaz hops, which evolve from bitterness to delicious flavor to, of course, uniquely spicy aroma. i have tried budweiser budvar, its czech counterpart, 2 or 3 times and find urquell still better. sometimes the original is the best for a reason. perfect.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"0.5 can from local store, brewed by carlsberg serbia. pours juicy dark lemonade color, with medium short lasting head. nice juicy smell. juicy taste with notable caramel flavor with a kind of cheap unpleasant finish. pretty sweet with orange notes, low on coriander. contains glucose syrup. fine taste of beer, well on carbonation, but too much sweet for my taste. nice for the summer on a beach. pivo nije lo e al nije ni sjajno, jake arome i vrlo slatko, podse a me na energetski napitak sa ukusom. ukus piva podjednako prisutan sa aromama i fina je kombinacija ukusa. zavr nica razo aravaju a, ali sve u svemu, zadovoljan sam.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"pours a dark molasses producing a great thick coco colored head and good retention. aromas - bready yeasy hop burnt grain. there s come other notes of chocolate, caramel, and light toffee. flavors - strong smoke pine hop coffee dark chocolate. more on the subtle side of wood and roasted grains as they come through more burnt. highly bitter, high smoke flavors, strong burnt bitter aftertaste, slightly cloying, and just a hint of alcohol. overall a top rate imperial stout that leaves a sting of aftertaste flavors on the palate to let you know they put quantity and quality ingredients in this beer.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"very pale golden color, largeish head with big bubbles and lace. very mild, hoppy and somewhat fruity aroma. citric-hoppy, slightly malty flavor with a sugary, slightly harshly bitter finish and no aftertaste. light-bodied, quite smooth palate with balanced carbonation. a very easily drinkable, but not watery lager, with hints of the fruitiness of some lighter belgian blondes. not that bad, although it has no real taste to offer.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"bottled. golden with a fine, steady white head. initial strong hop aroma escaping the bottle, then it settles down to be less exciting. not masses of flavour, smooth slight hop that transitions into bitter, then slightly tart flavour. smooth consistent palate. no surprises. there are plenty of czech beers better then this mass market one.",Negative,Neutral,Negative

"if the ultra is ultra cold, it is barely passable. but, if you re sitting on a porch in the middle of the summer and you take a break from the conversation to sip a now slightly warmer ultra, prepare to be ultra, ultra disappointed! even the color doesn t look rightlike they threw in a splash of black malt to give the brew some color. the problem is that it gives it that color urine has when you ve swilled about three cups of coffee on a bleary monday morning. forgo tact and loudly decline this beer if your friend offers you one, despite their best intentions. because with friends like that, who needs enemies.",Negative,Negative,Negative
this was a very light beer with not much head when poured from a bottle. there really was not much flavor and i would put this in the class of many of the macro pale lagers,Negative,Negative,Negative
"my favorite so far of the leffe lineup. the pour is a lighter shade of brown red. the head is un-impressive, beige. the nose is wonderfully fruity with hints of flowers and nuts. the flavor is the best part as it should be, the beer is sweet, with an undertone of fresh malts overpowered by citrus hops. the palate is perfect, not too heavy not too thin.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"11.2 oz. bottle from trader joe s. pours dark brown turns black. light tan to almost eggshell white head. nose of mild yeast and malt. taste of mild caramel roastiness, slightly grassy, a bit of dark chocolate with a little hop bitterness on the back end. it s dry and light an excellent session brew. tasty for what is essentially a light beer.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"bottled dark is definately the right word. very deep brown color is darker than the bottle it comes in. smells a little better than it s un-dark cousin, but loses slightly in the taste and palate departments. it s something to get if you want heineken but they re out of the green stuff.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"freshly tapped appearance clear, golden color, with a prodigious, snow-white head of foam, pristine, creamy, inviting. aroma slightly hoppy, with a typical lager smell, dry and clean, still fresh, though this is the very last pour from this keg. taste crisp, tidy hop bite up front, slowly fading off, but returning with each sip, very smooth, eminently refreshing. a sweetish taste emerges, with notes of honey and citrus. light bodied. snappy, tasty, with a pleasant finish. i anticipated liking this less. in fact my first try was from a sample bottle provided free. wasn t moved, even disliked it, at first, but it grew on me. on tap, as you can tell from other reviews, it s quite a nice, simple, thirst-quenching, quaffable pils. i can easily understand it s popularity. there s just enough flavor to make this well worth drinking, and not be just another pizza chaser , bland lager.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"pours a very pale gold with a bright white head. the head looks as though it should disappear in no time, but it continues to build from the bottom and lasts for quite a while. the aroma is pleasant a bit sweet with hints of spices. before going into the flavor i have to admit that white beers are usually not my favorite. however, this beer has enough spice and other flavor to balance out the usual taste of the white beer that i found it quite enjoyable. the flavor is crisp, a bit sweet, with a variety of spices mixed in. the beer doesn t have as much flavor as i would normally like, but it is easy to drink and is pretty refreshing.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"i have been aging this bottle for at least 4 years. more integrated and more complex. musty and foggy coffee, vanilla bean and dark chocolate. beautifully viscous and complex. long caressing finish similar to affogato, but with a gorgeous finish similar to red wine. better than old vintages of stone irs? hard to choose.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"july 2006 - i can t believe i haven t had this yet. anyway, being the least expensive of the readily available german hefe s, i wasn t expecting this to be all thatand i was pleasantly surprised. straw color, huge head and lacing. absolutely beautiful. sweet bubblegum smell with wheaty aspects. the flavor was also a tad sweeter than the other hefe s, more bubblegum, less clove. mouthfeel was extremely smoothcoulda convinced me my bottle came from a tap. maybe a little less full in flavor, but if drinkability were a factor, i d give it a 10. delicious!",Positive,Positive,Positive

"since trying schlafly s coffe stout i have been in love with this sub style. i was told by joe @ corral liquers in granite city, ill. that bells was surpassed by it. ladies and gents this surpasses them all a nice blend of flavors that at first seem harsh for the palate. by the third sip your hooked as the combination of 25 ibu s of hops, sweet high viscosity mouthfeel, perfect carbonation, undying aromas bond with your senses. i will still drink schlaflys but this i will savor and crave for my next one",Negative,Positive,Negative

gave this one a shot to keep an open mindwon t make that mistake again. i tried it while watching gordon ramsey toss his cookies on hell s kitchen and i almost joined him. smells like tomato paste tastes likeyeesh! salty and not much else. this could actually be a good combination with a beer big enough to stand up to all the fixins but bud just vanishes. to paraphrase the late douglas adams this tastes almost but not quite completely unlike beer . i could rant all day but i can t put it any better than nimrod did below a catastrophe of a beer.,Negative,Negative,Negative

this is one of the most disgusting beers i have ever tasted this is why your average young woman hates beer! horendously rotten vegetable taste with elements of wet dog and general lager charcter lacking very other little aromas. taste shockoingly is similar making me want to vomit in the nearest possible bin. lacks any positive qualities. carbonation is good but i feel this is just to hide the poor quality of beer. y on earth is this mass produced amatures!,Negative,Negative,Negative
"draft at the black squirrel. pours a dark black. thin brown head with lots of retention. nose is lots of coffee, some dark chocolate, but mostly coffee. really thick palette. vaguely reminds me of a dunkin donuts mocha coolatta. i know it s sacrilegious to compare the two, but meh. lots of coffee and roasted malt flavor. overall very good, but you knew that from the other 1200 ratings. i prefer the canadian breakfast stout, which i think has a more complex flavor profile.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"it pours pale yellow with a white head that has little in the way of head retention. there are some grainy sweet aromas and a light appleness to it. the aromas are not strong. there are some grainy sweet flavors and light apple, but nothing else. the balance is slightly towards the malt as the flavors are not strong. the body is light and watery with a slight carbonic and metallic bite in the finish. overall, this is a light beer with slight balance towards the malt but little else in the way of flavor elements.",Positive,Negative,Positive
"i had to re-rate this beer. my first rating had some problems. 1 i was drunk when i was writing the review and 2 i was drunk on miller high life. this beer is better than budweiser, but still could use some work. one of the better domestic macros i ve had.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"i have some kind of a sentiment to this beer. it s not the best but it s kind of unique and maybe because of the good memories i prefer it to commercial lagers. on the nose its very specific-aromas are desperados aromas. rather than tequila you can pick up lime, citric acid, alcohol artificial resin and pine . also not very pleasant metalic scents and even something like wet rag. clear golden colour with decent carbonation and nice fine-bubbly head which lasts long and leaves lacing . when you taste it, you can taste tequila. also some lime, very strong citric acid, corn but the biggest problem is glucose syrup which makes it something closer to carbonated drinks rather than a beer and kills all the bitterness from the hop- you can only slightly pick it up in the aftertaste. very light body, high artificial acidity with sticky texture. you can describe the taste without a doubt as an artificial . i think it used to be better. so why do i prefer desperados to commercial lagers? the answer is simple- it s not only good memories, it s because of that desperados has some taste at all and commercial lagers are completely blank.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"pint 5620 always pours out a stupid sized thick white cap that never disappears regardless of if it s poured out of a bottle or out of a tap. cloudy yellow gold brew. smells fresh! wheat, yeast, weak banana that changes to more of a over ripe banana when warmer but still mild in strength, some soft malts. there is an unmistakable banana taste but it remains milld throughout, light spices, a bit sour, more wheat, dry and slightly bitter that gives it a bit of punch. quite carbonated and not as smooth as i assume it is but i still find this very refreshing. odd plasticy feel shows up often but is not bothersome, slight biscuit in the after taste as well. countless pints countless.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"bottle in beach bar, nyon. this is a very curious beer. comes in a very small blue bottle and was served with a lemon. it s basically a violation of the blanche style, with a load of chemicals loaded into a bottle to make it taste like a mass market palatable version of hoegaarden. i d think of it as an alcoholic soft drink or a shandy rather than a beer, and if you start from that base it actually tastes ok, especially on a hot day in the sun. cloudy yellow, not so much wheat character or yeast, peachy lemony sweetness, bit of spice, virtually no aftertaste.",Negative,Negative,Negative

280417. bottle from dan murphy s. i first rated this beer back in 2009 at the beginning of my craft beer journey. as part of my 50 beer challenges that i have set myself for 2017 i have deleted my previous rating and re-rated this beer. one of my challenges is to re-rate 10 out of the first 100 beers that i rated. while this beer is considered a classic and rejuvenated the style i found it a little underwhelming. plenty of clove and banana in the aroma and also in the flavour and finshes with a peppery bite that is nice. i originally rated this beer at 3.5.,Positive,Positive,Positive
"500 ml bottle poured into a hefeweizen glass. the aroma is a mellow, creamy banana and vanilla with a complimentary clove and some subtle undertones of peaches. the beer is a cloudy pale with a hint of gold to it, and is topped by a creamy and frothy white head that retains well and leaves a light lace. the taste is a mellow and mild medium sweet with medium low bitterness. a creamy texture and carbonation go down smooth and easy with a medium body containing notes of fresh baked bread, banana, orange, vanilla, and a light woody clove spice that finishes clean with a lightly bitter clove and citrus zip and crispness that mellows quickly and turns over to a light oranges and nila wafers combination which stick in the aftertaste with a touch of lemon, and a lactose hint. quite delightful.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"tap at o brien s during the second annual san diego beer week in november 2010. this was my second attempt to go to o brien s to get the kopi luwak speedway. and just as at the first attempt at the first sdbw in november 2009, i went to o brien s and the line was way out the door. so i went to downtown johnny brown s instead and returned to o brien s on my way home. fortunately, there was no line and i got to enjoy several of the rare speedways that were left . anyway, this pours the usual tarry thick black and has a nice head for a rather small sample. aroma is excellent fresh roasted earthy coffee with nuts. flavor is sharp roasted coffee, like just cracked open roasted coffee beans. also a nice nuttiness, some rich chocolate, and hints of bourbon. the bittersweet coffee flavor is really standout hereprobably my favorite of the five sample speedways i tried this night. earlier rating 6 1 2009 total score 4.4 have had this many times in san diego. this rating based on a growler fill from brewery. pours a thick black tar with no light penetration and a small brown head. aroma of roasted coffee and toasty chocolate malt. tastes of coffee and smooth chocolate. nice mellow sweetness and there s also a slight note of sourness in the taste. full bodied with a lingering coffee taste. the magnitude of the abv is almost completely hidden, so need to be careful. but got the rest of the growler left and it s oh so good",Positive,Positive,Positive

"i love budweiser. don t get me wrong i understand it does not stack up to good craft beer, but i love it anyway. i think to apreciate budweiser you have to grow up drinking it, kinda like vegimite. i was in europe for awhile a couple years ago, and after awhile i really started craving it. i don t drink it all the time, but it is worth a permanent spot in the refrigerator. .",Negative,Negative,Negative

"pours clear amber brown with a short tan head diminishing rapidly to nothing, no lacing. nose is banana, dark boozy fruit, toffee and raisins, mild yeasty wheat. taste is moderately strong sweet, mild bitter. full bodied, low carbonation, lingering boozy finish. i want to call bull on the origin story . yes, partial freezing will concentrate the flavour by removing water - kind of the opposite of the angel s share alcohol loss - but that only works if you remove the ice. it doesn t work with a sealed container that will rupture during freezing. maybe, just maybe, a wooden barrel would expand enough to allow partial freezing - but you d still have to remove the water ice before drinking though, now it occurs to me that if you just had a chunk of ice still present in the barrel when you tapped it hmmm ok, maybe it s viable. regardless of the validity of the origin story, this is one heckuva beer. flavours are very similar to an abt - deep, dark, and rich - and despite the huge abv, are extremely palatable. and man, does the abv sneak up on you! this is a great beer to get very, very drunk with - or better yet, to get someone else very, very drunk with.",Neutral,Negative,Neutral

"after having peche mortel i always get excited to try new coffee beers. thanks to px2grafx for trading me this. poured a dark but not quite motor oil dark body with a huge head. i thought i was pouring a saison. it was pretty frustrating waiting for the head to die down before i could finally drink this. aroma had coffee, oats, and a hint of chocolate. the aroma wasn t nearly as assertive as the flavors. this thing is loaded with coffee. unfortunately, it wasn t like the coffee used in peche mortel. it wasn t like what s in speedway. those coffee flavors are good, this is like adding folger s coffee to a beer. the coffee flavoring added a light bitterness. the mouthfeel was also a little bit too crisp for my liking, it felt overcarbonated. it looks like wws has some competition for being the most overrated beer in the top 50 at least imo. 2016 rerate, original rating 5 17 2006 listed above. black pour, moderate sized tan head, decent lace retention. aroma is a blast of coffee. same deal as before, but maybe not so much - yeah it s a big coffee aroma but it s no peche mortel. light chocolate, light caramel, lightly vegetal. medium bodied, coffee dominates. 7 3 7 3 15 instead of 6 4 6 2 11.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"poured from bottle into nucleated pint glass. pretty average pale lager fare, but i do appreciate heineken s 100 barley malt recipe. most macro-breweries cheat with corn, rice, or other adjunct sugars. heineken also claims to use a proprietary yeast strain distinct from the one used by almost every other lager brewery, and i m pretty sure i can taste that. i can sometimes detect a minor skunkiness that other reviewers observe, but not always. people say it s because the hops go bad in the light green bottle. maybe, but i suspect it has less to do with ingredients and more to do with an industrial-scale brewing process and lengthy, non-climate-controlled import process. it s still better than many pale lagers made here. i love holland. i love the bottle design. i love the grocery store mini-keg concept. i want to love the beer more than i do. their dark lager is better.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"the classic draught has returned! is there really a difference in this and the can draught? i don t think so, save for maybe a minuscule hint of a metallic taste that is prevalent with all canned beers. tall head due to the nitro. dense microscopic bubbles. nose is light roasted notes and light coffee. taste is streamlined version of the aroma. mild palate and creamy due to the nitro, again. finishes with lighter roasted notes. always a favorite.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"decent lager, i don t like the bitter taste that is associated with the after taste. i usually drink lots of beer, and after drinking 3 or 4 heineken the after taste and bitterness becomes more and more apparent. this therefore makes it not a stand-alone easy drinking beer, although it is quite delicious when accompanying a hearty meal. decent brew.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"in the unusually slender can. this was the only free beer at a wedding reception recently attended. it s hard to appreciate the mass appeal of this product, but when offered for free with no other beer option, it s the best . pale, oh so pale. so pale that i am not scared of it. this beer might actually be scared of me. if co2 was not a colorless gas, i would speculate that it actually had a head, but the bubbles don t actually get together long enough for such a cohesion. sort of the way a good rocky mountain isolationist might want to separate himself from the rest of humanity. my tongue registers the tingle of these bubbles, but i can t discern other evidences of flavor. no hops are present. no malt body answers the call. i see a lot of chicks drinking this beer in some bars. i think a lot of people are drinking this. maybe they are attending a lot of weddings like me. update 5 2008 had this on tap again at another wedding reception. see a pattern here? after my first rating of 0.9, i think that i was a bit too generous with this beer. i think that i could actually taste acetaldehyde and perhaps acrolein, so the toxic chemicals in this are a bit of a turn off to me. otherwise, great beer.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"bright pale straw color. weak 1 finger head, quickly dead. highly skunky smell with some corn. faint bitter malt flavors, slightly citrus. light slick body with prickly carbonation. faint and short bitter finish ending with a smoky skunky dry feel. overall too bland, almost no flavors. a little stale, missing some freshness.",Neutral,Negative,Neutral

"the aroma was what stood out for me with this beer. bananas and clove, very sweet. not the most memorable beer, but definitely enjoyable.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"appearance was hazy orangish gold with billowy white lasting 4 finger head, spotty lacing. aromas are sweet malt, then fruity esters of yeast, slight wheat, bananas, clove, bubblegum. taste is heaven in a bottle with fruits of bananas, clove, bubblegum, mild lemon, sweet malt. palate was creamy crisp co2 with light meduim body, then glorious average length slightly warming fruity finish. the best wheat i ll had.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"bottle. pretty average, piss-poor lager. it s always fun to come on here and read the history and other opinions on beer, such as the fact that anheuser-busch produces this beer in the states, for example. much like what i d expect from them, this is a pretty below-average beer. for a lager, it s certainly decent. not much flavor to be had other thanmeh, beer. no aroma to speak of, and no lingering body. squarely alongside dos equis, miller lite etc. good with chips and salsa. 4.9 alcohol.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"when colorado was hit with a massive blizzard just a couple days before my flight to paris, i knew what i had to do buy some beer. my instinct was correct, for it wasn t until the day after christmas that i was finally home. spending those miserable few nights without company was more than i could handle during these pseudofestive times. aventinus weizen-eisbock was attractively robust and showed well in the past sips i had gleaned, so i opted for it. poured in my trusty chalice, the apparent mahogany glow it exuded was attractive but diminished by a rather mundane white layer, fizzing off rapidly. shortly, its rich and buoyant aroma silenced my skepticism and gloriously released the avalanche of vanilla, juicy oak and brown sugar that i remembered. cherry, red apple, maple syrup, balsamic vinegar and strawberry quickly followed suit. a noticeable presence of alcohol delineated this potent concoction following to the palate and burgeoning to a rather unpleasant burn. what transpared from the flavor was a dense and syrupy amalgam of cherry, grape, plum, banana and cotton candy, still shielded by continuous ethanol as if it were seen through stained glass. the opulent tones of vanilla and oak continued to satisfy my thirst and thrust the palate in an attempt to overcome the heat. a fascinating brew, but one i would have enjoyed far more with a slightly less alcoholic mordant.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"can. stale cardboard, bread. pale, pale yellow with lots of carbonation, a thin head that dissipates very quickly and leaves no lacing. very little taste, except for some skunkiness in the finish. i can see why this is the beer of choice at frat parties. you can drink a lot of this stuff and not feel a thing.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"mild banana esters join with lemon citrus character and some tart wheat in the nose. opaque tan body is topped by a fizzy white, large bubbled head that reduces rapidly to a lasting cover with slight lace. strong banana esters in the flavour which is quite sweet up front before the tart wheat comes out along with fairly strong bitterness. mild iodine-like flavour appears in the aftertaste as it warms. very crisp carbonation to the refreshing medium light body. mild warming. feels a bit subdued for a weizen bock. weizen glass. just above fridge temperature. bottle. brewery creek. aug-08.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"golden, cloudy. rich thick head. aroma yeast, dough, some lager notes, a bit warmer metallic with tobacco. taste nice tarty citrus a bit heavier than your classic weissbeir, almost a hint of ale. chewy and interesting. overall the dunkel of this is the gold standard for me. this is a solid weisbier. touch more malt than many other weissbiers. so well balanced and pleasant. palate is smooth and easy.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"fully hazy pale yellow orange colour, obligatory greenish shine collapsing whipped eggwhite head, just yellow tinted. freshly cut oranges, wheat, yeast and very faintly clove. citrus leaves . short sweet, nearly dry taste. fruity notes, especially oranges, but keep floating more or less high above the dry wheat main flavour. warming up, getting a bit of solvent. well-bodied, wheat slickness, oily mf. not really that spectacular, just decent. actually that sums about up what i ve thought about the worlds oldest brewery products for a few decennia",Positive,Positive,Positive

"11.2 oz bottle with stamped best by date of 3 2014, served in a paulaner weissbier glass. pours hazy light orange-amber with a large frothy white head. good retention and lacing effects. aroma sweet and spicy banana notes with some wheat. taste slightly sweet with a pronounced, but not overpowering banana note. bready malts. feel crisp medium-light body. o well above average for what is not a favored style",Positive,Positive,Positive
"guiness is great. smooth and creamy. not very carbonated at all, which i like since i am not a big fan of fizz. the tastiest part for me is the beige, substantial foamy head. my only complaint is a little hint of a taste in the beer i can t really put my finger on as sourness perhaps. otherwise, love the guinness.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"from the bottle pours a cloudy wheat with a fluffy and long-lasting head. the aroma is mostly hay with a spot of banana the flavor yields those, with a hint of lemon sourness, a hint of chalk, and a bit of copper. the mouthfeel is a bit thin but pleasant enough. drinkable, with no glaringly unpleasant features, but not a particularly impressive example of the style.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"poured a light gold, bright and inviting leaving a thin white lace. the aroma is sweet, fresh, hard to breakdown sort of plain some yeasty essence throughout. the taste starts crisp, dry, and actually nice. it has a small hop bitterness upfront, followed by a malty sweetness that dominates the finish with a lemon tart bite. overall this is a pretty decent brew which i accompanied with some sushi the perfect pair.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"bottled. this is almost going against the grain to say this sample wasn t as terrible as i thought it d be. admittedly there s not much flavor, but i had an almost decent hoppy aroma that could have been skunkiness. still, no real malt taste to speak of. but i could let this one in and say there was a bitterness. some. i was a guest, so i didn t turn it down.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"beautiful color deep cloud hazy amber brown. aroma is suprising. strong clove and nutmeg, spicy. bananas and vanilla in there too. flavor is a tad more fruity, but it still carries the spiced notes. it finishes a bit sour like they say, but it is quite bubbly and carbonated. spices definetely come through on the flavor. wonderfully drinkable, easily complex. all around just a great beer, enjoyable.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"every beer drinker needs to start somewhere. and this is usually the starting point. usually at a pool hall or college fraternity house. this beer is respectably good, for an american beer. it taste better than some other american beers, such as old milwalkee, or keystone, but is definetly lacking. probably due to cost cutting measures and the other corporate sins against brewers. i mean, malted rice of all things as one of their ingredients. however due to unmidigated mass marketing, it is a very popular beer. even though this enthusiast still prefers miller high life as his beer to drink with pizza, and while playing pool.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"7 20 02 i hadn t had this beer in some time, and i don t think i ve ever had it when not eating an asian meal somewhere. malt is an undercurrent in aroma, body, chief flavor characteristics and the finish. hops are prominent enough and produce a citrusy tang in the finish. this has more body than many lagers. tiger s main problem is a lack of complexity---the aroma, body, flavor and aftertaste are all essentially the same. in sum, this beer is not exciting but acceptable, and tastes a lot better with thai or indian food than as part of a session line-up.",Neutral,Negative,Neutral
"this brew has a nice golden color with a sm-white head. there is a mild grain corn aroma with a smooth watery taste not much to say here, but i think this is better the budweiser.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"can, with frost brew liner, leftover from a friend s party, poured into a pilsener glass. it pours a ridiculously light shade of yellow. i poured in a dimly-lit room, and it actually looked clear until i turned the lights on. small, fizzy white head and lots of bubbles, too. the aroma is extremely sweet, and i notice it before i even get my nose into it. strong corn and hay aromas come out as well, with some plantiness. it doesn t smell good, but at least it doesn t outright stink like a lot of other beers of this class. the flavor is water more than anything. the flavors of both candy corn and real corn give it a strange sweetness that i strongly dislike. the finish is slightly carbonic, and gives it a seltzer-like tone, especially with all the wateriness. there s nothing particularly offensive about this beer, but then again, there s nothing there to be offensive. blah.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"12oz bottle in an english pint. pours black with an even brighter beige head than the breakfast stout . aroma of chocolate, oatmeal, and bourbon. the bourbon dominates this beer in every aspect, and being from kentucky, it is absolutely perfect. it has the roasted malt and oatmeal flavor initially, but the oak bourbon flavors outweigh this. it has the finish of chocolate and coffee, but the bourbon is stronger. this beer is incredible and worth every penny. edit 2013 batch. still incredible. still has a lot of bourbon. still better than almost every beer i ve had.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"bottle, shared between good friends at delirium cafe, brussels. pours - as expected - a jet black body with a creamy, majestic caramel head. nose is mainly coffee, hints of dark chocolate, heavily roasted malts and vague caramel vanilla tones. taste is an extremely well composed symbiosis of major coffee flavors, dark chocolate and roasted malts - the classic imperial stout components blended with exquisite craftsmanship. smooth palate. while this is a rock solid beer, i still miss some of the original cherry-on-top elements that separates the awesome stouts from the epic, mind-blowing stouts. in my opinion, speedway stout merely reaches the former category, while it seems to be rated as the latter. having said that, this is a stout that will make anybody s day, without a shadow of a doubt!",Positive,Positive,Positive

"a pours out like 10w30, with hardly any head, but what is there is light brown - none of this tan colored head - it was the color of brown sugar. s wonderful! tons of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, bourbon, hints of vanilla, maple syrup, and bread. i could catch whiffs of it a foot from the glass - it saturated my nose. t it tasted superb, as well the alcohol was perfectly present, along with the java and dark chocolate flavors, and even a hint of maple syrup. if i had to drink a beer for breakfast, this would be a good choice. there was a lingering dark roasted bourbon flavor. m rich and creamy, with an appropriate measure of carbonation to complement the alcoholic bite to it. d no, you couldn t keep pounding these, but it s a lovely, awesome beer to drink. i love drinking it, and i m so happy to live in the city in which it s brewed.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"just to preface this review, i think a little disclaimer is in order. i like toffee and caramel, i like liquorice, i adore wheat beer, and positively worship coffee. and to complete the package, black is a personal favourite colour of mine. it comes as no surprise then that despite what is becoming an increasingly apparent palate of frighteningly diverse enjoyment in almost every beer style i experiment with, once i go black, there really is no going back for the night. stouts, porters, schwarzbiers and dark milds, i seriously cannot get enough of them. shockingly, it would seem i also adore dunkel weizens. a combination of all that i love in beers, and a wheat beer rolled in one? never stood a chance kiddo. so, erdinger dunkel, what can we say? poured into a recently acquired erdinger glass, dunkel could quite easily be a main installment in a modern art exhibition. it is quite frankly stunning. pouring a opaque deep brown almost approaching mahogany, it throws a magnificent eggshell hued head in a delicious reminiscence of an espresso con leche. on the nose there is the subtle suggestion of cloves and banana typical of the style, accompanied by warm treacle toffee, espresso and possibly a hint of dark chocolate in the mix? taste is a revelation. banana? check. cloves? very, very subdued, more dominating is a mix of malt and demerera sugar sweetness approaching burnt toffee, followed by a dark roasted coffee and a very subtle bitter finish. magnificent. a medium carbonation lifts the creamy wetness typical of weizens, ensuring that the body remains wholesome and full like a good wheat beer should, while at the same time give that outrageous thirst quenching quality and preventing the flavour-body combination from becoming too cloying. overall, i would be extremely ignorant to declare this as the best dunkel weizen i have tried, seeing as it is so far the only one. however if this is even a middling representation of the style, i see me enjoying other examples very, very much. happy gulping!",Positive,Positive,Positive

"originally reviewed 10 28 2011. 12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. 2011 vintage. jet black with a small tan head. it dissipates with some wispy lacing on top. smell is coffee, bourbon, and heavy roasted malts. dark, burnt chocolate. what s amazing is how well all three components shine through, without any one overshadowing the others. taste follows the smell. bourbon first, then some coffee, followed by a very roasty malt character. it s fairly bitter throughout, mostly from the coffee and the roasted malts, which give off even more coffee flavor. distinguishable is a chocolate flavor, but it s very dark and very burnt. i first thought the malts were a bit harsh, but on a second tasting, i appreciate more than founders could maintain the intense stout flavor among the bourbon and coffee. amazingly light, considering the abv. low carbonation, but that s to be expected. it finishes quite bitter, which makes the lingering flavors a little bit harsh. a thicker beer might make for some mellowing of these effects. really spectacular blend of flavors.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"75cl bottle, straight from my brother bob in la jolla sd. i know it sounds ridiculous but has been kept a year and a half in a fridge. pours a cappuccino full brown dense head, shiny black petrol look with dark brown reflex. now comes the best thing of this brew imo, the aroma, 11 10. full cocoa, sweet roasted, caramel, with a really bourbon like warm feel and aromas, wrapping and with a milkshake, boozy chcocolate fantastic feel, boero like for italians.taste is huge towards a mellow coffee, with cocoa and caramel hints, some vanilla, amarena black cherry, wood you can see it as a corretto macchiato espresso, the milky touch seems really there. medium plus level sweetness, incredibly well dosed, low to medium roasted coffee bitterness overall a bit on the sweet side but incredibly balanced and so pleasant. creamy mouthfeel, medium to full bodied. the final sweet roastiness plus the boozy bourbon finish leaves the palate with a full aftertaste. comparable only with the top shelf barrel aged stouts would like to try other editions of this. incredible stuff, smoothest imperial stout i ve ever tasted",Positive,Positive,Positive

"reviewed from notes. this was poured into a pilsener glass. the appearance was a semi-dark red color with a light transparency about it to allow light streams of carbonated bubbles rising. the head was about a finger s worth of white foaminess that dissipated within about a minute. lacing was stringy and smooth. the smell had a fair toffee, light chocolate and a little bit of earthiness with a light apples. the taste was mainly sweet and bready. the apples come back slightly. on the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. the carbonation was somewhat sharp but still lending a decent smoothness about it too. overall, this was a pretty good vienna lager i could see myself having again.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"weissbierbrauerei g. schneider sohn is a pretty harsh name for any non-german speaker to say without fear of damaging their epiglottis. but it s a misleading experience for anybody drawing on german culture from a bottle of this purple clad aventinus. you see, i think it s easy to come away with a perception of germany as heavy foods and harsh words, but when we do we lose a sense of prussian elegance a nobility that easily matched the french in culture, sophistry and a sense of noblesse oblige . beginning with its wrappings and down to its flavorful core the aventinus weizen-eisbock is a brew redolent with the sense of richness. a shade of brown like the fertile fields of flanders sits squarely in the glass with a non-descript head cresting the rim. it s dark with passivity but patient. a very forward aroma advances from the glass to preach a blend of rich coffees married with powerful and balanced malts. raspberry and chocolate, a natural couple follow closely, offset by copious alcohol and finally attenuated to a peeping wheat and biscuit taste. all these flavors glide effortlessly on a smooth and full bodied palate like a merlot, mimicking its vineyard county cousin with a touch of muscat thrown in leaving the overall taste dry and high, giving the drinker an uncanny sense of thankfulness for the berry benison. aventinus weizen-eisbock makes for real suave drinking. a thick and satisfying palate with equally thick and satisfying flavors promises the drinker a complete and satisfying experience. as far as german tradition goes, this is yet another combatant in the long war of attrition to dispel the horrible legacy american industries have wrought with their beer for the masses. and as far as i m concerned it is a noble fight. all the better, i think, to restore a good name to a good culture of brewing from a refined and rooted germanic tradition.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"here we go, my first fbs that is just a week or so old. a malt beverage brewed with chocolate and coffee , 60 ibus, 8.3 alcohol. comes in a stubby-ish 12 oz bottle with a pop off cap. pours into my american pint glass. looks like syrup as it pours and forms a thick 2 finger burnt caramel sandy looking head that sticks around before receding and leaving behind some fine lacing. a thick layer of head stays on top. the beer it self is pitch black, and i mean 100 opacity even on the fringes. smell is heavy on coffee with that thick, fresh, bitter roasted coffee shoppe scent. also hints of dark chocolate, dark fruit, and brown sugar. coffee and malt madness for the most part. smell carries into taste in a massive way. huge coffee bitterness up front with the decadent chocolate in the middle, finishing with coffee infused hop ibu s. im not a coffee drinker but the taste of this one doesn t put me off one bit, especially with the huge sweet and roasty malt backbone. the subtle lemon hops can be found in the background with a concentrated taste and subtly accent the coffee superbly. burps reveal more hops which mix beautifully with the bitter coffee. mouthfeel is decadent and super full bodied. there is a great amount of carbonation and a coffee-like smoothness that caresses the tongue. the drinkablility suffers simply because this is such a big brew. the alcohol isn t completely hidden though it doesn t hinder the drinkablility, rather it accents the flavors and warms. i can t wait to try this again in winter. that being said the massiveness of this one gets you full with one bottle. overall one of my favorite stouts, for my personal tastes it doesn t make the top 20 but there is true quality in this stuff that isn t hidden even to someone like me who isn t into the big coffee flavor as much. the addition of hops and chocolate really help this one be more palatable for non coffee drinkers.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"of all the beers i ve had this has the most distinctive flavor. it s really good. the first time i had this was in helen georgia where they charged 7 a glass. it s worth it though. it has a nice, cloudy, honey colour and a white head. very good but the only wheat beer i think i ve ever had so i need to try more so i can start comparing. imported from munich. i m actually drinking it right now! i drank this out of a lager glass",Positive,Negative,Positive

"although the head is thick and rich increases a delectable aroma of banana and fresh wheat beer. the flavor is banana, ripe fruit and a particularly rich flavor of wheat. slightly spicy coriander put a fine edge on its otherwise sweet malt fullness, and its light and almost anonymous hop bitterness provides long harmonious finish. the alcohol is relatively high, but set in the background of its spicy sweet filling.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"sapporo is a very low on the middle of the spectrum sort of beer. disappointing really, and not worth the import premuim. the aroma is stale, like the flavor, both very apparently corn laden. it is a little sweet, seems to totally lack an appreciable characteristic of hops, and is rather bland. its carbonation is decent and sort of like champagne , and its head is consistently moderate. i would say skip it unless you are just determined to check it off the proverbial list.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"bottle - pours hazy golden amber with a thick white creamy, foamy head. nose is bold, rich banana and juicy tropical fruit, a touch of clove, and a thick yeastiness. taste emphasizes the sweet fruity notes, overripe banana, lots of yeasty bread, and a touch of plastic and clove. smells great, but the taste really falls short. a little too carbonated also, but overall pretty smooth. man, this would be fantastic if the taste matched the aroma.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"i couldn t believe i hadn t rated this until now. i thought for sure i trashed it, but i guess not! pours piss yellow with a decent head. has the typical american standard aroma that sickens me. tastes very thin and has no body at all. finishes very blandly also. drink only if it s free and cold, and then only sparingly! you have been warned!",Negative,Negative,Negative

"after the international night of swill earlier this week, i swore that i wouldn t have another lousy beer for a month or two, but i was out tonight at a club where a friend was playing and was given a drink ticket on the way in. the beer selection was pitiful, so i figured i might as well use my freebee to tick off a rating rather than let it go to waste. amazingly, i don t think i ever had a bud before tonight, and i doubt i ll ever have one again. colour is a very light yellow. very active carbonation, almost frightening really. aroma of plastic water that rice has been boiled in. flavour is pretty much non-existant - when i started, it really seemed like i was drinking tonic water, and once it warmed up, i got just the vaguest hint of something beer-like. the popularity of this beverage is a sad testement to the declining tastes of our culture",Negative,Negative,Negative

"brad and i are having fun acquiring and drinking beers from around the globe lately. fun little project going on here. so here goes my first beer from singapore. the beer is clear and light golden with an inch or more of pure white head. mild effervescence. the aroma offers lager yeast, adjunct character, cereal grains, mild sweetness. the flavor pretty much follows suit. adjunct lagers are certainly not the most complex or refined beers around, but for the style, this one is alright. clean and refreshing. delicate sweetness with a bit of a fruit candy finish. i wish the finish was drier. overall, this was inoffensive, though uneventful as well.",Positive,Neutral,Positive

"i was not sure why it took me so long to get around to rating this one, but after opening a bottle i figured out why. this is a really average beer, and is again a case were marketing seems to be better than the brew itself. some odd odors greet you, after pouring golden with a medium white head. hops are the main flavor, and not much else. how in the world do beers like this sell so well when there are so many better alternatives out there.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"16 oz. can. body is a light straw color and is lively with carbonation that forms a pretty massive head. aromas are simply foul. truck stop urinal with cigarette butts and cheap aftershave are as good as i can describe it. i m a little worried about going blind from this before i hesitantly take a first sip. it s not quite as horrid as i expected sweet corn syrup and wreched funk combine to leave an aftertaste that is on par with the aroma, but for just a second or two, before the aftertaste sets in, it seems like i might escape with no damage. i tried a couple of sips to make sure i was on target and then poured the rest down the drain. i could hear the foul liquid trying to eat and hisss its way through my plumbing system. even several minutes later i am still hostage to the unearthly aftertaste. nothing redeeming about it.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"in glass it s seen like a regular lager with a clear golden pale color and a small and unstable head. the aroma reveals bread, cereal, grass and ginger notes. when is tasted it has light sweetness, medium bitterness and a light body, with a thin feel and an astringent ending. neither the best not the worst beer to try.",Positive,Negative,Positive

"weizenbock. 7.7 abv. nice fresh wheaty nose. first mouthful has a nice clear carbonated mouthfeel. very well rounded and gentle. nice almost fruity slide into the hops which are fresh without being harsh. not too much alkalinity, you don t feel like you re getting a mouthful of pot ash. there s a residual hint of formic acid reminiscent of the head on a delirium tremens. one of my nicer gentler beer experiences, lulling me into a false sense of security then giving me a nice buzz to remind me that it is 7.7 abv after all. thank you, vitus! i love you man! goes on favorites list.",Positive,Positive,Positive

in tropical weather i didn t want anything heavier than this. drank this on numerous occassions in various kopi tiam throughout kuala lumpur and penang. the open-air eateries are all stocked with this. light-bodied with a slightly dry finish. it seems that the refrigerators they keep the beer in aren t very cold but surprisingly this didn t taste totally awful at room temperature so it gets points for that. good for cooling off your palate which might be burning hot from the curry mee you just ate.,Negative,Negative,Negative

"pours a very clear light golden color that you could read through without any problem. head disappears quickly but it laces decently. smell of skunk weed upon opening . i want to say i can detect a sort of grainy hoppiness after it sits a couple minutes. taste is much better, with some cereal corn, oat, and a mild maltiness. leans toward refreshing, though there is a bit of body to it and little carbonation. there s little there to tell you it comes from belgium i don t recognize a yeast or malt characteristic. i guess i don t hate it. had to get this one out of the way.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"gold with a fizzy head diminishing quickly. initial skunky aroma gave way to hoppiness and straight-up grain with a bit of grass or hay. flavor was lemony hops right up front becoming tangy sweet grain malt with a bitter hop finish. palate was a little watery, but overall a dependable czech pils.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"this beer is putrid. it is reminiscent of heineken, but skunkier. i have tried this a couple of times and have always been unsatisfied. the balance of flavors is terrible, all malt and adjunct with no hops. it looks like a watered down ginger ale i guess the only positive is the carbonation.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"one of my all time favorites, a welcome and well deserved classic reputation. an almost narcotic nose, pungent, full and rising with the noble saaz hops dominating. crisp, golden color, clean and balanced carbonation with a rather nice but rapidly diminishing head. some bavarian lace on the sides of a tall pilsner glass, but again a bit sparse. flavor is refreshing, clean and pleasantly bitter, filling the mouth and sides of the tongue with a rich, malty sweetness. palate is smooth, richly bitter and lingering. a very pleasant aftertaste that begs for another deep draw, a call better served by waiting until the full flavor develops. take your time and be rewarded.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"there exist not words in the english language to describe how awful this beer is. i ll tell you a quick story my buddy and wanted to drink late at night around 12pm. the only place open was a gas station. since he was the only one with a fake id, he went in solo. we had 7 bucks and had decided that we were going to have to settle for a six pack of something decent like corona. well, being younsters and thus inexperienced in the art of beer, he couldn t believe that you could get a 12 pack for about 6 bucks! we got back to the party. i forced down 4 and 2 3 the way through the fifth, my body found itself lunging over the balcony railing and disposing of the vile urine. my buddy made fun of me for being a pussy. i told him to go fuck himself and that i was going to bed. in the morning, he notified me that he had hurled about 10 minutes after i had. serves him right huh. at this point it was obvious that neither of us were going to be drinking the last 3 beers, we tried to give them to a bum, but he refused to accept them. anyway, this beer is awful. don t even think about it.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"lots of personal history with this beer almost don t want to subject it to beer snobbery, but here goes draught can. black with creamy off- white head, just like the picture. faint aromas of roastedness, caramel, and earthiness. flavors of roasted malts with a slight bitterness lurking throughout and an overall hint of sourness. creamy and light mouthfeel, very smooth. a pretty fine approximation of the tap. during college, our favorite diner served pitchers of guinness. i learned to love the stuff as my own. there s nothing quite like holding a pitcher upside down for minutes, awaiting the last few bits of chewy guinness head to slide out. a long-time favorite.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"my first one had an initial aroma of coffee, dark chocolate, some fruits and alcohol was also present. apperance of used motor oil with a thick dark tan head that settled quickly, and left plenty of lace. flavors of roasted coffee, which was heavy all the way through. it also had hints of fruit and the dark chocolate was also quite noticeable. together they all blended well even though the roasted coffee was dominant, still the others managed to get noticed. overall a pretty fine brew, i am glad i finally found some. however on opening my second last night it wasnt as enjoyable because the alcohol dominated everything in both smell and flavor, it was kind of disappointing in comparison to my first sample. guess that i will have to drink a third one to see what the truth is.originally rated on 10 7 2008.",Positive,Positive,Positive
bottle. light sour barley malt aroma. golden yellow color with moderate but short-lasting head. slightly sweet barley malt flavor. weak but just probably better than bud select - actually not horrible for a 2.5 ab beer and no off tastes.,Negative,Negative,Negative

"12 ounce can. pours golden yellow with a decent, clingy, white head that lasts. like the regular and lite versions, but has a very clean aroma and taste. some malt, alcohol and sweetness comes through. is a little watery, but is more palatable than the other versions. not a bad beer, as it has a high alcohol content and is pretty cheap.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"i found this beer surprisingly disappointing. maybe, it s an issue of age or something. at any rate, the beer pours a straw yellow color, a shade darker than other japanese lagers, with a puffy white head. the head dissipates rather quickly, leaving some lacing. the shade of yellow is a bit strange, but perhaps that s just my opinion on the flavor aroma of the beer coloring #40pun #41 my feelings on the appearance. the odor is light but still off-putting. it s on the weak end of the spectrum of macro lager aromas but definitely not the bottom of the barrel. the flavor is a mix of bitter, grassy hops, cheap super pale malt plus adjuncts #40rice, i guess #41 and a mildly stomach-turning sourness. the mouthfeel is light with some graininess. drinkability isn t horrible, either, but it s certainly nothing to write home about. it s light and sits easily, but i don t think that i could finish this enormous can by myself unless i was fairly drunk and not really noticing the flavor.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"half-liter bottle adorned with lemon and electric blue label graphics. the foggy, strawberry blonde liquid rolls forth with a fanfare of billowing, airy fluff that boasts herculean stamina. fantastic fruity spicy aromas leap from my glass- apricot, honey, raspberry syrup, tangelo, musk, currants, key lime, and lapsang souchoung. the round, malty flavor also features jammy fruit, spiced red grape jelly, cherry, and spruce. bubblegum and five-spice enhances the warmly ethanolic finish. a refreshing, juicy mouthfeel is light and lively with carbonation, but not overcrisp. heady afterflavors of expensive gin, incense, hawaiian punch, rosehips, and ruby grapefruit are hammered home by a retronasal clove cinnamon karate kick. this beer resembles a liqueur cocktail, friendly yet complex and contemplative, and just screams for pacific rim cuisine, crisp spring rolls with fiery chili sauce, jamaican jerk barbecue, bacon-wrapped scallops, or simple grilled knockwurst with purple cabbage kraut.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"judging by the top ranked beers, i can see i m in the minority for not being a fan of stouts. however, i gave this a try and i was surprised. wasn t bad at all, and i would drink it again, but not in large quantities. aroma was caramel, oats, chocolate, coffee. appearance was very black, and not much head on the pour. had a sweet and bitter taste throughout as i drank with strong notes of the coffee and chocolate . it packs 8.3 , but it wasn t noticeable to me. i m guessing after a few you would be feeling it though. i can see why this ranks well and it makes me want to at least try some of these other highly rated stouts now, even if they aren t my drink of choice.",Negative,Positive,Negative
"not bad at all, but i expected a much fuller body. compared to other stouts, guinness comes up a bit watery and i m put off by the sour tones. i ve heard people say guinness is a beer you can eat with a fork. more drinkable than i thought, but that s something i look for in a lager, not a stout.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"a steady pour produces a two-finger thick, off-white pale-tan colored head. the beer is a pale amber golden color that shows a somewhat hazy, brighter version of the same when held up to the light. the aroma smells wonderfully hoppy with notes of ripe guava, kumquat zest, peach nectar, pineapple, herbal piney mango, green peppercorn, grassy weedy herbal notes, a bit of dank hoppiness, and a candied, concentrated citrus zest character. light bodied, but not thin, with a medium carbonation, the malt character provides a hint of toasted, pale nutty character, but really this is just a vehicle for the hop character. the hop character is predominantly fruit focused, but there is a supporting herbal, grassy, slightly dank and spicy character here as well. flavors of pineapple, lots of floral peach concentrate, tangelo zest, kumquat, guava jam, lychee, piney mango, and lots of juicy fruit bubblegum notes. there is a hint of toasted pale malt character here, and a rounded hint of honey hinting malt character, but only enough to support the hop character. a wonderfully hoppy pale ale that really showcases the citra hop character. i really like the tropical fruit focus with ample supporting roles by the dank and herbal character.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"this is a hard to find beer on the west coast. thanks harpreet. kind of funky aroma giving way to wood, chocolate, coffee, campfire, and a hint of fruit - not much. it has a small dissapearing dark brown head. the taste is sweet and sour with a heavy duty smoked wood bitter aftertaste. hints of chocolate and coffee and a thick body give this beer a good balance between the sweet and bitter. a very lively brew with the alcohol not noticeable at 8.3. not terribly complex, but tasty and satisfying.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"this is beer, plain and simple. in fact if i m being completely honest i m having difficulty describing this beer in terms that aren t base and parochial. it does not taste bad, though i can t put my finger on exactly what it tastes like. the best i can come up with is if you were at a roadside diner somewhere in one of the dakotas and they presented you this beer and told you it was water you may question it, hell you may even send it back. as far as a taste is concerned there are subtle hints of aluminum can and questionable water. that s where this review ends in a constructive manner. it s the beer to have if you re running from something or chasing the dragon. there is an overwhelming sense of guilt and disappointment while you re locking lips with this brew. even your body knows it s doing something wrong causing you to evacuate the vile stuff every 13 minutes the seal does not stand a chance. pros low cost. cons everything else.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"clear purplish cola brown with a foamy, thick mocha whipped cream head with incredibly long retention. a lot of plum, banana, black cherry esters with some white pepper and clove phenols and touch of basement must. malt aroma shows the dark malt cookie batter and char roast character well. quite aromatic, nearly all of it yeast-driven. yeast and malt-driven flavor, some tartness but a lot of sweet, simple, cola-like malt with the yeast giving some life to taste candy sugar, cookies, potpourri, almond marzipan and bananas. after a time the banana esters are too strong, approaching dunkelweisse territory. firm carbonation that suits the body well. so this is a beer i ve had more than a few times, but not for years after finding it growing simple, dull and tasting manufactured, so i was surprised to find it in good shape here. the malt is still pretty dull, but the yeast much more vibrant and expressive than before, and mostly clean as well, which is nice to see. reviewed blind so i no idea of batch or date. i ll probably try to find a bottle in good shape to review again, but after finding out the result i was pretty surprised, so here s a somewhat high rating for a brand and company i have no reason to like.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"12 oz bottle 2009 vintage courtesy of either binnys south loop or sam s south loop . poured into a tulip, a pitch black thick viscous pour with small dark brown head that laces some, never dies completely. aromas take a touch of smoke and oak, vanilla and chocolate mix liberally with bourbon, bitter roasted malts, and some soy sauce. pretty good, just a little surprising. after warming a bit, some good sweetness comes through, syrupy and similar to the breakfast stout. good ash, coffee, and roast going on. initial is thick, putting on a good heavy body, warmth as it flows down the throat. good oak, dryness, and vanilla mix with ash, assertive roasted malts, some lighter chocolate in there as coffee bitterness takes some of the more prominent sweet bitter clash. this brew takes on large roast and coffee bitterness further into the body, much lighter on bourbon than i would have expected, until some notes of vanilla and oak peek through. surprisingly, for 11.2 , this is fairly quaffable. bitterness, roast, coffee, and touch of smokiness. the bourbon is less noticeable than other barrel aged brews, a tad light for me even. this is pretty good, but a little light on the palate and in body for the style. cheers to it! edit this beer impr",Positive,Positive,Positive

seriously there is just something about this beer that does it for me. it s very well balanced and tne malt and the hops have endless aromas and flavors. it will hold it s own against any other beer you drink. try it after drinking a belgian and the malt holds up as well as the noticable layers of hops. drink it with ipa s and the sweetnes and and depth of the malt comes through. it has a melony kind of thing going on that i have yet to really find in another beer. i believe it comes from the hops but they have it so well balanced it s not in your face like some of the other pale ales from the nw. i t s my go to,Negative,Positive,Negative

"appearance typical lager straw hues under a white head which fades into a thin head, slightly thicker along the sides. swirls average. nose grass and grains. lemon peel. key lime peel in the back. golden sundried raisins. sun-baked grains. palate typically clean with lemon peel and lime in the middle while grains mingle about. rather dry. finish with just a touch of citric peel atop the tongue. dry sweet bread crusts along sides. final thoughts it s alright. not horrible but not great either. for me it s all about the nostalgia and the massive amount of sushi i have enjoyed with this beer until i discovered really good cold sake.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"it is what it is - a run of the mill german lager, and that s not necessarily a bad thing it s just not spectacular. while the first wiff of becks smells like a skunk, the aroma turns into bitter, hoppy combo when it hits the palate. this brew is moderately acidic and bitter. it s got bite and a lingering aftertaste.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"appearance- cloudy apple cider, even cloudier. whole loota head, some lacing. aroma- fruit and bread, little apple scent. body- full feel, as expected, not as chewy as i would ve expected- think the hops evened out that wheat chew. alcohol is present but relatively hidden for 8 . flavor- wheat backround is minimalized by stronger hop bitterness even resin flavor than other wheats. picture some sort of mixture betweeen a a german wheat and an apa. main wheat flavors are present, but the subtle ones are lost. the main pale ale characters are there- hops bitterness giving a pine flavor. even the color is a mixture- short of amber deeper than gold. all in all, i enjoyed. but i m not sure if this is one i can drink a few of exclusively. but it is enjoyable to crack open one bottle and enjoy",Positive,Positive,Positive

"this was the first and last time i will try this beer. sampled from a 12 oz green bottle this beer poured a straw yellow color with a small soapy white head. the aroma was sour and skunky. the flavor was sour malt, skunk, and a bit corny. the mouthfeel was surprisingly thick which was the only redeeming quality i could find. drain pour. any brewer who consents to putting the beer in a green bottle should be banned from ever brewing again",Negative,Negative,Negative

"purchased about 1 month ago no bottle date. slowly develops a 1-finger dark tan head after pouring. the beer is a very dark brown, near black. the aroma has some roasty coffee notes, but also a medicinal note and some green wood. it s not particular appealing, but not off-putting either. the first sip is an explosion of coffee and chocolate. unfortunately, it s chased by that same green, medicinal flavor and a bitter woody finish. the mouthfeel is heavy and coating, but a bit chalky. almost no carbonation. overall, this is a bit of an enigma to me, though. it s better than the sum of its parts and i keep being pulled back for another sip.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"pours clear brown and settles black and seems that it will have no head, but it shortly produces a series of tiny bubbles which build a medium sized tan head. aroma can be sensed from several feet away. it is chocolate and coffee up front and hides a fruityness behind the robust malts. the first sensation is how smooth and creamy it is, very full feel. the coffee flavor is both roasted and bitter and is followed up with a slight smokeyness. this beer has a great reputation and didn t let me down. such a great presense, this beer carries its weight and is a must have for anyone who enjoys good beer.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"a - poured a 500ml bottle into a weizen glass. cloudy orange, good amount of sediment particles dancing about, big fluffy head that stayed and went to some nice lacing throughout the glass. a - big floral hops cover up the hidden, banana, clove and bubble gum. this is a beautiful smelling beer with a nice complex aroma. the hops are mostly floral perfume like w some citrus underneath. t - floral hops, sweet grain, bubblegum and banana - some really spicy notes that taste like a mix of yeast hop profile. p - creamy, big carbonation, medium bodied - this beer feels really nice with a big full swig. o - fantastic collaboration of east west and styles. i would love to try this fresh one day.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"decent appearance for a lager. the ultimate blue collar beverage of choice, but let s face it at best, this beer is tolerable. otherwise, it is very unimaginative and uncreative. sure, it s smooth and refreshing, even slightly malty. but the taste really goes nowhere. far too watered down and thin, in fact most ab brands are very middle-of-the-road and uninteresting just like this one.",Negative,Negative,Negative

excellent beer one of my favorites but definately not for everybody drink only on tap if you want the true guinness experience,Positive,Positive,Positive
"a st. patty s favorite, guinness is a respectable stout, if overrated. no beer tops its black, frothy-headed appearance. however, this beer consistently lacks carbonation and complexity. a good choice when faced with budweiser swill, but pales in comparison to american craft-brewed stouts.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"i drank a free sample of this at a convention i was working. you can t beat the price, or can you? it was in a plastic cup and deserved to be it had a pale, bilious yellow color with a hint of green in it and looked like nothing so much as a urine sample from someone who was not in the best of health. a few small, fizzy bubbles in the body, as in a ginger ale, but there was little carbonation overall. it was at least cold, which i guess was something. there was almost no head left, of course, but there was some slight lacing from it. the aroma was very faint, but there was a hint of apple in it that wasn t too bad. this was the beer s best feature, actually. very, very thin and watery on the palate. the taste was bland and nearly invisible it tasted like a watered bud, if you can imagine such a thing. not a trace of hops. alcohol hum very weak, disappeared almost immediately. boy, was this bad. i felt sorry for the guy who was talking it up at the counter, he seemed like too nice a sort to be pimping for ab. this was being promoted, by the way, at a convention for old people. maybe ab thinks that old folks are too dim to drink anything good.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"pasteurized, so it is crystal clear with no sediments. golden to straw colour. lively carbonation. not much aroma other than hints of grass and sweet bread. taste is average light lager, a bit sweetness and some flower and bubble gum. mouthfeel is dry, yet quite refreshing at 8 degrees celsius. rather have this one instead of, say efes.",Positive,Negative,Positive
"5 02 2009 consumed individually, neither bud light, budweiser, nor clamator juice is really that bad. i have nother really against any of them on taking singly. however, combine either bud light or budweiser beer with clamato juice and it creates a horrendous beverage that is pure acrimony. this pinkish-colored abomination smells like watered down tomato vegetable clamato juice. the worst part is the horrible thin clamato juice flavor that has a light beer note to it combined with an excessive level of carbonation that makes this beverage super fizzy. i almost gagged on the first drink and then each drink got worse and worse. there really isn t a lot of alcohol in the drink, but the hyper carbonation and terrible blend of flavors causes it to go straight to the head. almost instant headache! i think the bud light chelada is slightly worse than the regular budweiser chelada, but there really is no way to tell the difference between the two , but they are both absolutely nasty. there is no way i could ever drink a full can of either of these as just several drinks of each was way more than i should have ever had to begin with. these are the worst mixed beer beverages i have every had! stay away stay very far away from these 24 fl. oz. can from kenny road market in columbus, ohio shared by my good ole buddy jason. thanks, i think rating #191 for this beer.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"i m curious how good this beer would be when it hasn t had to travel halfway around the world. it pours a cloudy amber with a large, frothy, off-white and diminishing head. the aroma is of cloves, citrus, bananas and a solid yeastiness. light and slick, it finishes crisp and clean. the flavor is a sweet yeasty front with a light citrus and banana segue to a solid wheat finish. a very clean and refreshing drinker i could drink these all day long.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"when people complain about american beer tasting like water there is no beer that deserves this reputation more than natural light . the beer is so tasteless that it s impossible to identify any particular flavors or ingredients it s all one big mish mash of indistinct impurities that build up on the tongue over the course of a case or so, which is basically what it takes for the average man to get any kind of buzz off this kind of beer. the only reason anyone rates this beer as anything higher than rock bottom is due to some nostalgic loyalty they feel they owe it, their high school college naivete clumsily overriding their more recently acquired good taste. there are worst tasting beers than natural light, to be sure, but none consisting of more unadulterated tap water. i imagine you could safely fill up a fish tank with this swill without fear of killing off so much as a guppy.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"the archetypical american pale ale , from a time when craft brewing in the u.s. was still in its infancy along with anchor s liberty ale, which has been in existence for just a few years longer, this beer paved the way for the even hoppier ipa storm that has conquered the world ever since. still one of america s best selling craft beers and though i had this before some thirteen years ago, i was quite surprised to find it at an albert heijn supermarket in belgium so i decided to buy a bottle and give this landmark in american beer history a re-rating. initially very regular but thick, egg shell-white, very moussy head, nicely lacing and stable, though gradually breaking open in the middle cristal clear old gold robe with deeper orange-peachy hue, especially when the sediment is added and it becomes more hazy. aroma of dried orange peel, warm toast, cooked turnips, chicken spices, fried potatoes, some iron, apple peel, bitter honey, raw spinach, young bitter wormwood in spring, old cloth, soap, straw, withering dandelions, industrial breakfast cereals. restrained, clean fruitiness in the mouth, hinting at unripe peach and green gooseberries, only very subduedly sweetish, more dominated by a deeper, dim and generic sourishness and a vague bitterishness announcing hops to come minerally carbonation effects but not exagerratedly so, yet still a tad sharper than i am used to from an apa. mouthfeel is a bit roughened by this, but otherwise remains slick and supple. cereally and eventually very softly bittering toasted maltiness in the middle with a very light metallic zing to it but nevertheles adequately supporting a resinous and spicy hop bitter finish, a tad grapefruity, drying but still remaining relatively gentle as expected from the style, while juicy, bitterish toasted maltiness passes through. retronasal aromas of old dried citrus peel and pepper accentuate the hoppiness in the finish. i can imagine a beer like this being revolutionary back in 1980, showcasing the then-young cascade variety alongside established german noble hops but at the same time, i cannot help but feeling this is a bit out of date now, in a time when new aromatic hop varieties come out all the time and ipa has largely overshadowed apa in the states . even among apas, this feels quite european indeed, even though generously hopped the american way. regardless of all that, its historical influence on the american craft beer movement - now spreading the world and even penetrating old beer countries like belgium - remains untainted, and technically this is still a solid beer by all standards. very happy to see it appear now in supermarkets here in the low countries as well.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"reviewed from notes. this was poured into a pilsener. the appearance was a decent transparent golden yellow color with a two finger s worth of white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute and left a ton of thick foamy lacing gracing the sides of the glass. carbonation was seen rising at a mild pace. the smell was mainly sweetened corn. the taste was sweet through the corn. there was a light corn-like aftertaste with a quick sweet dry finish. on the palate, it sat pretty light and had a pretty good sessionable quality about it. the carbonation was fairly harsh but wasn t overly done. overall, i say this was a good beer. its nothing to go overboard about but still fits the bill with asian food. earlier rating 5 16 2014 total score 2.6 reviewed from notes. i poured this into a pilsener glass. the appearance was a light clear yellow body that leaves a soft foamy white two finger head appears that lasts for a good minute. spotty and foamy lacing embraces the sides of the glass. light carbonation is seen slowly rising. the smell had corn adjuncts up front with some rice as the beer warms. the taste was a decent mixture between the corn adjuncts, rice and hops leaving a sort of slight bitterness in the taste. on the palate, it sat a light to medium, pretty watery, nothing harsh on the tongue. overall, hmmm not sure what to say other than it does remind me a lot like aal s . i think before i go any further on being too critical with this style, i d like to try some other jappanese rice lagers.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"i simply hate to do this. this review is not a fluke. pours yellow, quick dissipating head, without a trace of lace after a few minutes. beer shouldn t smell this bad, besides the skunk , it smells like i lit a match in the room. crispy snap in the mouth, with the skunk just about destroying anything going on underneath and lingering around just long enough to kill any finish. it is one of the worst beers i have ever had. if i can t finish the glasswellit s horrid imo not just awful. a mistake and an insult",Negative,Negative,Negative
yuck! another typical american beer. at least i have this rating out of the way. this beer poured a large head with no lacing on the sides of my mug. it had a fruity aroma. it did have a somewhat smooth taste to it. there was no bitterness or aftertaste. this beer simply has no character.,Negative,Negative,Negative

"bottle, from cyprus. goldenrod sunflower orange with a happy haze. it s a nice color. head is alright, although would be nicer with more density and some lace, which is what makes me not rate the appearance any higher. aroma is very estery and proper bavarian style fruity with loquat and mild but not oppressive banana. this bottle must be fairly fresh because it tastes clean, the yeasty esters and wheat malts coat the tongue but the light body and lively carbonation make it refreshing even if prevented from reaching awesomeness. flavors are quite nice and welcome, balanced between the fruity esters and the clean wheat malts. overall much better than expected.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"this is the reason americans don t like beer. it s weak and flavorless, you have to drink it ice-cold in order not to taste it, it s clinically mass-produced, and anheuser-busch has such a strangle-hold on the market and on the politicians that it s hard for better, but smaller, breweries to hang in there.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"24 ounce can. another less common variant of bud that i ve come across in the last few days. while bud dry was pleasantly surprising with its elimination of some of regular bud s nasty finish, bud ice is definitely not a keeper. take bud and add a nasty harsh alcohol element. it just doesn t work. far to little flavor to cover up the alcohol, and what is this prominent of an alcohol flavor doing in a beer that s only 5.5 anyway?",Negative,Negative,Negative

"from the 330 ml. bottle stamped 04 17-l11765h. attractive amber orange pour under a frothy, lingering soft white head that laves lacing as it slowly fades. an inviting aroma of toasted bread, crackers, wheat, barley grain, and a lemongrass zesty character. the body is medium or better. the taste is a mellow malted toasted flavor with a squeeze of lemon or fruit to add to it. slightly bitter finish but overall nicely balanced and delicious. one of the best in this style.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"tap, cape of good hope, oxford. pale gold, pure white cap. almost no aroma--smallest touch of herbal hops. flavor is dry and soft, but so very neutral there is just about nothing to put your finger on. some very inoffensive clean malt. this is beer at its most precise, safe, and boring. you could drink this all night. butwhy bother? why not drink water?",Negative,Negative,Negative

"can from supermarket. standard lager but certainly one of the better ones. will get a higher rating when bottle tasted as remember actually quite liking this from the bottle. ----- bottle from supermarket. i don t know why i have some sort of starnge affinity with stella. i think it is becasue it was the beer my dad drunk and as a kid, the beer i would get a sip of if i was lucky. maybe for that reason, outside of the bottle it tastes repulsive but in te bottle, it is quite lovely . it cannot be all that, and i think it is superior to most rubbish on the market shelves and should strictly be from a bottle but hey, rant over. it is quite sweet, some eldeflower, some tinny lager ofc. 2.6 to 2.5. ----- keg at in den rozenkrans, leuven. well well well, first beer in leuven and appropriately its stella. went down an absolute treat. looked good. so smooth on the palate today. 2.5 to 2.9. -- keg at de flore margiet, leuven. 2.9 to 3.1. --- bottle at home in leuven. no aroma. a good looking beer with lasting foam from carbonation. easy drinking with a quite strong bitterness with a tang of sweetness. decent. 3.1 to 3. ---- keg at cafe commerce, leuven. very clean to no aroma. light gold with small lasting foam and very very light carbonation. taste is great today, even tasting hops, who d have thought. a good bitterness to it and slight spicyness. smooth. honestly, this trip has convinced me that stella, brewed here in any case, has to be one of the best macro lagers. 3 to 3.2.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"an american classic given a bad name by city-slicker beer snobs giving a good name by nascar loving countrymen. there is a reason why this beer is known around the world, and a lot has to do with marketing, but the taste is not all that bad. there is nothing better than a bud on a sunny july afternoon hosting and bbqing on the grill. this is indeed the great american standby.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"aroma is unfortunately, the epitome, to most, of beer in the us-it really gives beer a bad name-of course, most know this, but still it is one of the most popular beers in the world. its drinkable and cheap. for a pale lager its marginal at best, not horrible, but has a chemically sweet flavor of corn and rice and a vile aftertaste- i feel that these types of drinks should be in a separate beverage catagory aside beer because they are made to be thin and refreshing, not flavorful",Negative,Negative,Negative

this rating is in honor of my neighbor who never fails to offer me a cold bud when i am out working in my yard. this beer has a stale smell that is similar to dried athletic shoes. it is the color of butter and has a thick white head. this thin beer flows through the mouth depositing a sweet nutty taste which mildly bitter upon swallowing.,Negative,Negative,Negative

"can at ebf 08, thanks to fatphil. reddy-orange with no head. the nose is minestrone soup, but with an acidic tone that causes me to pull away at even this early stage. mouth is evil, with liquidised devil and satan on the side. anybody who thinks hmm, what this beer could use is some tomato and salt - should be castrated with a blunt wooden spike. needless to say the taste is tomato and salt. awful. it might go well with pasta, but not with a glass. quite simply the worst beer ive ever tasted. not just unpleasant, but offensive too. and that takes quite a talent.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"sampling this after having the blonde version only a few days ago, this didn t strike me as all that different in flavor despite the significantly darker color, so disappointing in that regard. average belgian excessive sweetness both on the nose and on the palate, fruity complexity. maybe a little bit more roasty maltiness to this brew, which should be obvious considering the brune style, but is rather underwhelming. again like the other leffe varieties, good but not really authentic.",Negative,Positive,Negative
"bottle. pale hazy yellow pour with abundant frothy white head. aroma of ripe bananas, wheat and strong spicy yeast notes. taste is deliciously refreshing, not too hard on the banana clove, light grainy wheaty taste with a spicy finish. palate is good, lively carbonation and not too sticky. good hefe, i think the taste is the real strong point here.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"this beer has all the bells and whistles you d expect from a german wheat. banana, clove and a nice balance of hop and yeasty flavor. it s a little darker in color than most weizens but finishes light. this beer remindes me of late summer, sitting in my yard having lunch while i smoke a pork butt in the barrel for dinner. aahhhhhhhhhh pleasure",Positive,Positive,Positive

"thanks to fantomas23 for the bottle! black with a rich dark tan head. you can still find some of the breakfast elements here. the bourbon gives the coffee nose a nutty quality, some wood. flavor has more wood and bourbon, and the roast is largely more of a factor. a little milk chocolate as well. the mouth rather thin. overall good, the barrel mellows some of the vegetal bite of the normal breakfast, but it s still not very complex.",Positive,Positive,Positive

when you pour that bottle of schneider weiss into your glass you just know that this beer is special. it s a wheat beer but is quite dark in appearance. very pleasant to look at. also very pleasant to smell since it has a really pungent yeasty-citrus aroma that translates well into how the beer tastes. very easy to drink and quite tasty.,Positive,Positive,Positive

"dark reddish brown beer. nice soft drape of foam, after the thick fluffy foam has disappears. the smell is delicious. it has a undefinable aroma, which comes back in the taste. it is the special distinct taste of leffe. it must be in their yeast or their hops. the taste is perfectly balanced. it has a little touch of sourness. it has rather light body, i mean, not as heavy as you expect for a dark beer like this. however, on a wednesday evening, this is not a problem.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"no other grains or sugars rather says it all. although this stout is the very poster child for the classic look, feel, and even aroma of a traditional european dark brew, guinness patently unsatisfying taste has devotees turning elsewhere. the good ultimate color, a perfect foaming head, and a rich, dark, balanced and fragrant assortment of finishing agents - well-selected hops and roasted barley. the bad a thin, weak, watery base. the bad wins out . . . this brew is a better decoration than a satisfying libation.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"this beer pours a cloudy yellow with a large white head leaving some good lacing down the sides. the aroma for this beer is not very strong, which i prefer a stronger aroma for a hefe. but i can smell the bananas, and lemony zest. the flavors are about the same not very pronounced for a hefe but better than most. all in all this is a very well crafted beer, but it could use just a twinge more. cheers!",Positive,Positive,Positive

"this beer caused such a rampage during its release at my last fest that i nearly didn t even get the chance to taste it. happily, that near-crisis was avoided. and what a crisis that would ve been. i would ve missed out on this impossibly rich and thick brew and all its chocolaty, boozy, and syrupy goodness. there s a big bourbon note, but the barrel influences are exceptionally smooth. roasted barley, cream, and coffee flavors. this is a huge beer, but i could drink way too damn much of it if given the chance.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"hey! this crap is brewed under the strict supervision of sleemans the can also says japan s oldest brand - can you say misrepresentation? what a load of crap. too bad the beer is palatable. solid gold in colour and pours out a pretty big white bubbly head that soon goes to a skiff. the smallest dots of lacing. 97 clear. smell is non-offending, but too light with the only noticable odor consisting of weak grainy malts, faint hops and something else. not skunky. taste is on the weak side sweet, dry and not much else aside from the obvious metallic overtones, but this does not make it undrinkable. mouthfeel borders around it being light bodied with some weak syrupy quality. fairly smooth, nice tasty and appealing bitter finish with an unknown flavour that fades. totally drinkable, in vast quantities and a definete candidate for the march for membership into the century club. also totally forgettable. just had a flashback of getting a body stone at an old girlfriends house after consuming way way way too much southern comfort with her and her dad - worth noting for sure!",Negative,Negative,Negative

"bottle. pours forth in ambered pale gold and rimmed with a heady froth in off-white. aroma carries distinctive, yet subdued standard banana and peach ester. calming. flavor is solid, but lacks the body i expected. hoping for more wheat oil and density, this falls a little short with some wafting caribbean spice through a mild fruit festival. clean, crisp and respectable. hop bite at the end in noble makes for an appreciable balance, yet i long for something more substantial. not sure this really deserves its lauding. in all earnest remarks, i could drink a shit-ton of this beer, served cold on a hot day. i see why the germans do. ps i think i m terrible with this style. it s probably, in all reality, exemplary for the style",Positive,Positive,Positive

"why have 2852 people already rated this? it was the most rated beer i had not had until now. i had been pounding the strip in las vegas all day and i needed a refreshing drink, so i bought a 25oz can in the treasure island store by the door and rushed up to the 19th floor to open my prized possession, that extra oz made all the difference you know.the view out my window of the encore and wynn helped me calm down as i began to drink my heavily rated brew. to be fair it did the trick, it was refreshing and although my taste buds were not required it was not offensive or nasty in any way, just a fairly bland, light golden lager. glad i have finally had one, but i will not be having another in a hurry. i did struggle to finish it though, as it warmed a little it started to change for the worst, i could detect a weak grain and metallic twang drink it fast and well chilled if you have one.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"335ml bottle from waitrose as part of a 3 beers for 5 offer. dated as best before 01 2022. served fridge cold into a tumbler. the beer pours a proud dark amber colour with a two finger orange hued head. uniform and thick. medium level aroma of citrus pith, floral hops and caramel. bittersweet. the taste follows the aroma. more of the caramel notes than i was expecting making this beer nicely balanced. more bitter citrus as it warms. nice length on the finish, bittersweet in the mouth, more citrus skin on the palate. a decent beer. nicely rounded.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"super dark pour with a small, near brown head that is gone in a flash and only leaves a thin galaxy swirl atop the beer and little if any lacing. the initial aroma is chocolate. that s followed by mild coffee and definite bourbon. the flavor is chocolate with mild coffee and some nice bourbon. the bourbon melds nicely with the coffee and chocolate, but this beer isn t as dramatic as regular breakfast stout imho. i found it to be a very drinkable, very well made beer that didn t have the aggressive stance found in bs, it was more relaxed, more sophisticated. the mouthfeel was very nice and the alcohol didn t assert itself at all.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"a little like an english brown ale in its nut and caramel sweetness, but with the same spiciness as leffe blond - for a second i thought i was drinking the same beer. sweet spicy aroma, nice maltiness, medium body. very very nice, if a bit too sweet to drink in bulk - it hides the alcohol a little too well",Positive,Positive,Positive

"sample at founders. i would drink this for breakfast, dammit! love all that coffee on the nose, and it s not so strong that it puts you completely on your ass. velvety and delicious. this is a stout that makes me love stout. hell yes. update proper review for the hell of it. pours a thick, dense, pure black with a finger or so of toffee-mocha head that settles slowly leaving some thicker lace. nose of fresh roasted coffee, deep dark bitter chocolate, peppery spice, perhaps some nuttiness, toast, a dash of sweet cream. quite sweet with plenty of roasted coffee and chocolate bitterness to balance, making it very drinkable for its size. slick and oily, creamy, velvet-like smoothness, full but never heavy, perhaps a touch syrupy and sticky, with a long bittersweet chocolate finish. about as well put together as it gets, and always a treat whether on tap or from a bottle, as in this case. bottle dated 11-24-12, so this one is nearing 4 months old, but to me it s drinking perfectly. this year s version, for whatever reason, i noticed some green pepper characteristics in super fresh bottles back in december, which must somehow relate to the coffee as i recognized similar character in another coffee stout recently. it wasn t off-putting necessarily, but i m digging this slightly older bottle more than fresher ones. i don t feel the coffee notes have degraded much at all, and probably won t for another 4 months or so. stellar, delicious, beautiful beer. can t wait for 6-packs next fall!",Positive,Positive,Positive
"enjoyed this brew in my samuel adams glass. the pour was thick and rich, with a dark mahogany color and very little head . excellent burnt coffee aroma, with excellent grain profile. hints of alcohol were also present, though it did not make itself present when i tasted it. this is a syrupy, thick-bodied brew, with some initial malt sweetness, balanced by strong coffee flavors, with a bittersweet chocolate finish. i like my beers to eat like a meal, and this stout certainly qualifies. the only downside is that i picked up one bottle of this for a pick-six at t-birds, in plainfield",Positive,Positive,Positive

"pour reminds of me of pepsi, dark and heavy carbonation with a nice tan head. smell of chocolate, espresso and the beach on a summer night the alcohol is nice and subtle on the nose. full mouth feel sweet chocolate followed by bitter coffee beans and a lingering yet subtle alcohol finish. overall impression is stellar, nothing to complain about at all.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"not too bad, nice head. i like that this one isn t too hoppy, but isn t sweet either, which makes it a nice thirst quencher. that said, i wouldn t go out of my way to look for it. has a macro-brew taste, but it seems to be a little more hoppy than pabst. it does taste a lot like pabst not impressed, especially for the price.",Negative,Negative,Negative

nothing special about this beer. pale yellow color. smells watery. tastes watery. it definitely has a smooth taste and is easy to drink like most light beers but i would consider that just a function of its watery-ness. good for men who want to get fat slowly.,Negative,Negative,Negative

"firm head over a cloudy brwn body. hazelnuts, earthy, rasberry, alcohol, raisin and cereal. body has some sweetness first but is dry overall. to the end it becones quite alcoholic, like a herbal distillate or snapss. interesting and unusual, but with rough edges. more a curiousity in the end than a beer i d like more often.",Negative,Positive,Negative

"surprised to find i had not rated this faded beauty. nose is banana, coriander, a little pepper a little orange. taste is coriander, wheat, banana, dough and a little almond. the finish is too short. it?s a decent supermarket beer, and often the saviour in a provincial bar. edit i think this is getting worse. now thinner and increasingly soapy",Positive,Positive,Positive

"pub-pour can. pours a silky black, with a milky tixture. this is a very approachable stout. i have always heard of guinness as being a beer you have to kind of build up to. simply not true. although the texture is really thick, and therefore may need some getting used to if you were not brought up on whole milk, i think this beer falls short of all the build up leading to it. don t get me wrong i enjoy this beer-the chocolate undertones and smooth coffe aftertaste are quite pleasant. typically, i choose a more full-bodied stout, but this has got to be the smoothest, and one of the most enjoyable porter stout s out there. approachable stout. good flavor. great with chocolate dessert. stay away from the bottled draught guinnes, stick with the draft-pour, or the pub-pour can.",Positive,Positive,Positive

aaahhhh yes the six pack i enjoyed during my vacation at sand key florida. enjoy the columbia restaurant. and try a mich ultra or two. they go great with real good spicy food. cause it doesnt compete in any way. guess it wasn t too bad or i would have thrown one or 2 bottles out. hey it s low in calories don t that count for ----oh yeah there s miller light for that. oh well!,Negative,Negative,Negative
"bottle from a friend, purchased at the beer store. pours a very watery pale yellow. smell is a little nutty. it s quite plain. it s your generic lager. no complexity at all in the palate. taste was bready, but unlike usual crappy lagers, this was watered down further. very thin mouthfeel. it did its job of getting the guys drunk. besides that, i don t see any reason why anybody would buy this beer.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"re-rate 2005. had this just after a guinness and smithwicks and it was easily the most flavorful of the three. the sourness in the finish is nice and while at times it tastes a little like sour citrus fruit it is balanced by the spices so never gets unpalatable. on tap at yeoman s road pub in tampa. pours a hazy gold. yeasty fruity, hay-like aroma. tastes of ripe fruit and spices. great mouthfeel like all wheats, substantial while still being refreeshing.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"on tap at pickles steakhouse. pours a hazy milky golden yellow with an average white head. aroma of lemon, wheat, banana, coriander and some other citrus. flavors of the same with a light sourness. unfortunetly this was served with a lemon which was immediately taken out when it got to our tablebut that may have contributed to more of the lemon and less of the orange that i was picking up. very solid witbier that more and more bars have these days.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"355ml. lumpy, 100 pitch with an uneven, shrinking manila head haloed with white- an odd effect i ve never seen before. aromas lush, raisiny high cocoa chocolate melted on burnt toast, blackcurrant, blueberry some strawberry and vanilla tones peeping through the blackness. huge, mouth-filing palate like a rich chocolate mousse flavour all about luxuriously bitter, high cocoa chocolate but with a lovely, softening streak of blackcurrant and plum running under it. still-smoking charcoal, lemon dabbed sparingly on barely edible, burnt pancakes. deep, inky, highly drinkable stuff with a fullness and pungency leaning towards the imperial even at 6.5 . impressive.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"rating #200! poured jet black with a medium fizzy brown head that dissipated quickly. aroma is delicious sweet chocolate and coffee. taste is mostly sweet, dominated by coffee with a hint of chocolate, with a roasted coffee bitterness. the finish is bitter but not overwhelmingly so. there s an alcohol burn but the alcohol itself is nearly undetectable in the flavor, making this almost a little too drinkable. rather impressive considering it s 12 . not fruity at all. overall this is primarily a coffee stout, just turned up a notch. the palate is nice and thick not kalamazoo thick, but thick enough. although i m not much of an imperial stout person , i find this beer to be very agreeable. i could have this every day, but it s too expensive for that, so i ll settle for once in a while. update wanna try something that s really bad for you? try adding a scoop of coffee ice cream for a speedway float!",Positive,Positive,Positive

"the pour is actually a very unappealing cloudy greenish-brown colour that almost looks like an aftermath of a bad lavatory incident. the head is your typical abundant fluffy, velvety head that you get from just about every hefe-weisse. the aroma is very bread-y with strong floral hints. the taste is quite interesting. it s definitely not your normal wheat beer. the hops is a more dominant in this beer. it s like a spiced bread. the spices would obviously be the more dominant flavours since bread is pretty subtle. i do taste some very, very subtle notes of citrusy fruits. but the subtle flavours are difficult to define through the intensity of the hops. as the beer warms, the sweeter flavours tend to burst a little more. it seems to become a little more caramel-y. i can taste some banana as well. this is like a very americanized version of a german style dump some hops into it! i like it. it s different. i don t enjoy it as i would enjoy the usual wheat beers, but it s quite unique.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"sampled at cellar s wine spirits in st paul, mn and shared by joebrew. good lord! i just dumped out the ice version of this beer. pours a clear light golden straw colored brew with a fast dissolving white head. aroma of more corn adjunct, some wheat malt character and more infused citrus chemical character as the ice version. taste is light bodied, watered down white bread with some citrus in the background. finish is light, gritty and then clean cut taste. this is sold only in 30-packs? glad the distributor supplied only a single can to test sample.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"my #900th rating. it poured with an opaque black body, with a thin tan head very little lacing no carbonation. aroma was fully of roasted coffee, and cocoa notes, but with a heavy alcohol scent, some oak notes. initially the flavor was very sweet, like dark chocolate. the chocolate notes gave way to a warm bourbon flavor. it could have had more balance. it seemed to be extreme chocolate, and then alcohol. otherwise this beer was great.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"aroma is caramel and alcohol. color is a near solid hazy amber with good carbonation and a tight off white head. taste is fizzy and roasted. starting with a light medium body it goes down with a foamy feel. finish is a mildly roasted caramel taste backed by a easy bitterness. in the after taste there is an alcohol feel and a slight sourness. not bad, but for some reason the alcohol is prevalent yet the content is not that high. i noticed this in the kristallweizen also, but not in the pikantus that has abv. of 7.3 .",Positive,Positive,Positive

"poured into various glassware over the years, the appearance was a jet black color with a one finger tan foamy head that slid off to allow a glistening spider web lace in the wake. the aroma had some sweet to grainy oatmeal then a mix of chocolate coffee blend underscored by an earthy hop base, then a moderate roast. the flavor was a lively blend of the sweetness of the oatmeal to chocolate to coffee and subsequently lead into the aftertaste with a fine smooth roast. hops seem to be extremely faint. the mouthfeel was about medium bodied with some sessionable traits to it. semi-dry finish with a good carbonation about it. abv felt as projected. overall, i have aged many of these over the years, but they never really seem to age past 9 months as the coffee portion does end up becoming acidic. so drink fairly fresh, friends!",Positive,Positive,Positive

"pours a one finger dark brown head, body is pitch black with no light penetrating. head retention is good and lacing is above average. smell is of roasted espresso beans and smoky burnt malts. sweet chocolate syrup is also in there mixed with alcohol. thats pretty much what dominates the aroma completely. taste is heavy on roasted coffee beans and burnt malts. there is also an aftertaste of bitter coffee grounds, it s almost like sipping on a double shot of espresso. hops could also add to that bitterness i m tasting. alcohol is definitely present at 12 but not overpowering. mouthfeel is medium bodied, nice and syrupy. carbonation levels are good, well carbonated for such a big, strong beer. head contributed some creaminess to the body, just not enough to give it a 5 drinkability is very good. would have given it a 5 but at 12 percent, it packs a punch. i love coffee stouts and it definitely delivers tons of coffee flavor. drank the whole 750 ml bottle and could have had another but with the alcohol content it would have knocked me on my ass.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"pours a deepest black with a thin, creamy mocha-colored head. the aroma is definitely coffee-centered, but the flavor combines the roasted and bitter coffee flavor with a subtle malt sweetness and the earthiness of the oatmeal. the overall experience is still very much like a blend of a good dry stout with some fresh brewed java, but with the combination being better than the sum of the parts. i find it to be not nearly as heavy as it looks or as its stats would indicate, and it is surprisingly smooth and dangerously drinkable.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"i ve had guinness served several different ways, but not yet on tap. i guess this is the closest thing to tap beer. it pours out an ink black color, and the nitro widget makes the beer extra frothy when poured in a glass. the cascading bubbles makes for an interesting experience to watch. i believe it even makes the beer taste better, because it brings the hop oils and aromatics to the top of the glass. maltiness galore, with the classic bitter guinness tastes are evident from the first sip. it has that hoppiness bite right at the end, and plenty more tastes in between. this is a really good stout, and it s consistent. that s why i like it so much.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"as a rule, i try not to read previous reviews before i write one. but for this one, i simply had to. and the reason is, i do not like this beer. i see it ranked highly all over the place, including this website, and i do. not. get. it. perhaps my handicap is that i do not drink coffee, and have not for years. maybe the ba version will be better, and i surely hope so, because this tastes like a cup of sanka with a shot of smirnoff in it. i m sorry, but a strong coffee flavor does not mean a good beer! i rely on these guys at alesmith to hook up the good beers, but this one is not good, unless you are a coffee addict. do you go to baskin robbins and order coffee ice cream? really? with all those other flavors available? well then i guess this is for you. enjoy. i ll pass. this beer is more for those who want to talk big, and talk others into thinking a bitter, burnt coffee taste with a severe alcohol burn is actually a tasty beer . no thanks.",Negative,Negative,Negative

another nice offering from the brewers at weihen. pours a golden yellow - i actually expected it to be a tad darker. thick white head. beautiful malty flavor that was perfectly balanced with the strong clove notes. this is really strong clove - not the usual subtle aromas you get with bavarian wheat yeasts. the clove dominates so much that i didnt get the usual other wheat yeast aromas at all. but this is a great beer. the slightly higher alcohol content that is typical of weizen bocks is masked a bit in this one. watch out and enjoy this one!,Positive,Positive,Positive

"while in ireland, i had my first guinness. i was not very impressed. however. . . . . . . . . . . . this beer is a global icon. for that, there is a respect this beer must have. every once and a while i will have one or four at an irish bar. not for the quality, just for the hell of it. the use of no2 adds points to this beer for two reasons. one the pour. this beer does not mind to put on a quick show for the consumer. two the mouth feel. the no2 causes this beer to feel like slik flowing down your throat. very nice. this beer lacks in the aroma and taste departments. aroma is very old world, dirty, musky. the flavor is very watery and murky. this is a basic brew, so one can not expect big undertones. but to get nothing but pale malt and barley can be a bit of a let down. however, this beer is not about blowing you away with flavor. it is what it is. basic and simple. once you take that into consideration, you may enjoy drinking it every now and then even tho the beer may not taste great to you.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"11.2 oz bottle, poured into a tulip glass at approximately 45 degrees f. a pours a pale straw, and is amazingly cloudy, to the point that i can scarcely see the shadow of my fingers on the opposite side of the glass. formed an immense head of white foam, that quickly fell away to a ring and several patchy islands of cap. no lacing to speak of, alas. s fruit and wheat spring out of the glass at first whiff, laden with nigh hefeweizen levels of banana and coriander spice. there s a tang of citrus underlying the primary aromas, and an overall sweetness that beckons to my hop-averse palate. t the flavor profile has a definite core of sweet wheat, around which the fruit and spice notes are wrapped. citrus notes abound through the beer, ranging from orange to mandarin and clementine, and the spice tones include coriander and just a hint of clove. tinges of white pepper waft through the background, and a faint whisper of banana skulks about the shadows of the ester flavors. m rather thin and watery, moreso than expected for the level of cloudiness in the glass. while i d expect most any wheat beer to be light-bodied, this beer lends itself to a quick flash of flavor across the palate, and then a lingering watery aftertime. o for a witbier available at my local grocery store for a reasonable price, this is quite tasty. a little more strength in the body, and i d call it a regular.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"oh boy. this was my first rating ever and it was in severe need of updating. man, i was a n00b. well, the truth is i can kinda remember what it tasted like when i had it way back when, but the reason i m updating this is because i just had a aged bottle, and to me, it just wasnt as good. i was kinda let down, but in truth, i liked it better pre-aged. that deserved a 5 5. but after 10 months of aging, something went awry. all the coffee notes disappeared, and the brew as a whole tasted a bit like bourbon. the chocolate notes tasted burnt, and it just wasn t as magical an experience as i had hoped. that being said, i am leaving my rating at a 5 5 because when i had that bad boy on tap @ the brewery in nov 09, it blew my tiny mind wide open and i have been looking for something equally as good ever since, since it isnt available where i live. fantastic beer with everything right, so long as you like imperial stouts, and the flavors of coffee and chocolate. otherwise its not your beer. i will edit this again when i ever get my hands on a fresh one.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"blurs the line between a pale ale and a session ipa, and not in a good way. bright flash of grapefruit, dragonfruit, and lemon zest quickly gives way to mild, barely-there malts and a modest, mildly bitter finish. the haze and the brewery have to be why this pint rates so high. it s okay, but a 100?",Positive,Positive,Positive

"i got one bottle from dra19 and one from dankman38, so whoevers bottle i opened last night, thanks! the pour was a semi-viscous and basically black blob that barely produced a one-finger head. tiny bits of lacing. the initial aroma is like i popped open a bottle of hershey s syrup. pure chocolate. not the dry baking-chocolate aroma often associated with stouts and porters, we re talking chocolate-chocolate. smoky, roasted malt comes into play briefly before the smell of burnt coffee beans espresso comes into play. the rest of the time i spent drinking this was a fight between chocolate and coffee over who would dominate my nostrils. no clear winner, but i ll give the edge to chocolate as it came out of the blocks stronger. the flavor was as you might expect, a lot of chocolate and a lot of coffee. i had hopes that the roasty malt and campfire that slipped in initially would come out to play or that some hops would come through, but i think the dryness of the oatmeal combined with the aggressive chocolate coffee blast took out any chance of this thing becoming super-deep in terms of flavor. the mouthfeel was ridiculously dry and the body was medium. alcohol? what alcohol? didn t even notice it. a great beer.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"i tried this one directly after the regular weizen-bock, and i have to say, this one towers over the original in flavour and complexity. the body was much, much chewier and was able to support the intense dark fruity boquet and chocolate flavour much better. it had just as much clove, banana and spice, along with raisins, cardamon, liquorice and molasas. the booze was hidden better than i thought it would be, but it was still definitely there in the finish.",Positive,Positive,Positive

can from an avond winkel in prague. poured a crystal clear light amber with a bubbly white head and lots of life! looks like a glass of lucozade. the aroma is light yeast and malt. the flavour is weak bitter with a watery hop bitter palate. light boded with fizzy carbonation. looks awful and tastes awful. what on earth were they thinking in the brewing laboratory when they came up with this one? were they running around saying i think we are onto a winner here boys ? i suspect they were not,Negative,Negative,Negative

has an acidic somewhat metallic taste. while it has a somewhat pleasant aroma it has only a light malty taste and a cheap soapy hops. the only things this beer is good with is strong food because it will compete with the flavor maybe even cover up a bad food taste.,Negative,Negative,Negative

"aroma of rosted malt, a bit sweet with some chocolate tones. the head is thick beige, but far from the nitro draught version. color is opaque black. flavor is of roasted and pale malts and dark bread, and then at the back of the tongue very hoppy bitter, and ends long and dry. medium body, soft carbonation ,",Positive,Positive,Positive
"i will admit, that in the bottle here in the states this is nothing special and quite overpriced, but it seems an entirely differnet beer when sampled in amsterdam on tap. a cleanly done lager with a crisp hop character. easy to knock down a little .2l glass in just a gulp or two on a rare sunny and warm amsterdam may afternoon.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"got this as a gift from my brother for christmas, and shared it with a friend here in ireland. poured into two different small glasses from a 12oz bottle and shared. pours very thick like a thick dark black brown molasses oil or something, but looks great with a 1 2 finger cream colored head that doesnt stick around too long. first smells are of coffee and chocolate, definitely what i would have imagined from founders out of this one. deep flavors of coffee and chocolate come through in the first tastes-exactly what would be expected based on the smell. well balanced i think and not too strong, but definitely has a kick. tastes great as it goes down and as smooth as a beer of this style can go down really-a bit sticky here and there. i d like to say i could drink this all night, as i do enjoy the taste, but i do know that it does pack a pretty solid punch. i have another one of these as well and look forward to a whole one myself.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"keg at schiphol airport having previously worked in the netherlands for many years, i feel this beer hasn t been given a fair chance in recent ratings, so i had a quick taste on a flying visit to amsterdam today. on draught it s a pale straw colour with a dense lasting white head, it smells of grain with a metallic edge, it s cold, sweet and refreshing with a hint of bitterness, but is a bit cloying afterwards. this beer is best drunk as the dutch do, cold and in small servings, with friends. it s not intended to be the centre of attention, so doesn t merit rating as a serious beer. however, in my opinion beer is always preferable to cola, so that makes this one ok.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"12 abv. imperial stout. poured out oily black. i don t really comment on the head, but this one had a rich creamy cafe au lait colored head. 40 srm. nose is actually milky and sweet and reminiscent of caramel, toffee, dates. the roasty aromas are coffee, charred wood, light wood smoke, over ripe stone fruit with honey prunes and black plums being top on my list. dark grape juice. mouthfeel is full and syrupy. palate has maple syrup, dates, date palm sugar and dark caramel and burnt sugar. light creme brulee. nice hit of alcohol up front and in the middle. malt palate is broad with maltesers, malted milkshakes providing a strong almost milky base on which to taste the roasted barley and coffee flavors. the bitter takes on a fuller, more pleasing dimension because it is lengthened by the malt. there is a spicy component ot the tail end of the palate as well, medicinal and spicy, with anise and licorice, overall comes across like ouzo. finish is wood smoke and pleasingly lingering. overall, an impressive imperial stout that is smooth and gentle on the palate releasing the complexity of flavor in a very controlled fashion over the entire tasting experience. goes on favorites list!",Positive,Positive,Positive

"bottle number 040372. beer poured out a burnt caramel color. smells of yeast and banana, wonderful! taste is caramelly with a strong presence of banana and various fruits. mouthfeel is very syrupy and has an alcohol burn in the end, though not enough to take away from the beer. drinkability is good, though i wouldn t want to have a lot. one is probably enough in a night.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"michael jackson s ultimate beer book features this as the prime example of the southern german hefeweizen so i had to try it. the body perplexed me- clear amber as opposed to your typical cloudy, unfiltered hefeweizen. the head was nice- big creamy and fizzy. the aroma was subtle- yeast, cloves, and spice. the smooth and again, subtle banana flavor was delivered with strong carbonation that sings on your tongue followed by a sharp cleansing finish. this is a good hefeweizen- worthy of being the prime example? no, i think paulaner deserves that distinction.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"wow, this stuff is good. don t know why i haven t bought this stuff when i had the chance before. i guess the label always threw me off. pours a great deep black with thin tan head. aromas are amazing. of course you get the coffee, but there is molasses and a sweet maltness as well, and the bourbon smell taste is just about right. tastes about identical to what i was smelling. i will be stocking up on this whenever i have a chance.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"date stamped on bottom of can e0906, which i presume is 09-may-06. having just consumed as much asahi super dry as i could stand without vomiting, i figured i d compare it to this sapporo silver bullet and wow, this is light years ahead of asahi. it has that lightly grainy flavor you expect from a pale-colored lager, it s free of off-flavors like cardboard, and there s a hint of bitterness in the finish, but the moderate sweetness keeps the beer from being as clean and refreshing as the drier lagers out there. body is light but not watery and carbonation is moderate. the mildly aromatic nose is a light grain and again, moderate sweetness. medium straw in color with excellent clarity, carbonation streams would look gorgeous, but there s just not much going on in that department. the small, white head settles to a ring, leaving a few spots of lace on the glass. not a bad japanese lager, it s probably good with sushi, but i m not enjoying this enough to ever be motivated to buy it again just for drinking.",Negative,Negative,Negative

thedm and hotstuff vacation brew 54. this brew poured a medium sized head of finely sized white colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a straw yello colored uncarbonated body. the aroma was almost non-existant with only a few mmild hop notes present. the mouthfeel was tingly from the hops. it had a thin hop flavor. i still think this is an insult to good german beers!,Positive,Negative,Positive

"the only available beer at a recent gathering. this really didn t do the job, which is sad, because so many other mediocre beers would have sufficed. as expected, it was watery and lacking in flavor. just a hint of malt. for as unappealing as it was, i do appreciate the fact that it s a good beer to drink if you need to drive anywhere--at 3.7 , you really would have a tough time getting drunk off of the stuff.",Negative,Negative,Negative

"this decent beer poured a dark brown color with a hint of red. it was a clear , medium to light bodied brew. the two finger head was dark tan and bubbly, but disappeared quickly. it smelled great i got hints of the classic caramel roasted malts and maybe a little sweetness as well. my first thoughts were a pleasant fresh malty aroma. the drink, like the aroma, was also a little sweet, but with also a subtle hint of hopy spice. although i can t really put my finger on the beer s aftertaste, i think it has a hint of chocolate. it had a nice clean finish, even though the beer had a pretty strong carbonation. i found this beer sitting in my refrigerator, apparently someone else had brought it over. i personally would not buy it it was however better than the heineken lager. i would definitely recommend a leinenkugels red or even sleeman honey brown lager, which are both considered american dark brews. a decent beer, but not something to spend your money on.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"this beer has a long and complex history. the schneider family holding the faith for weizenbier during a time when nearly every other brewery was switching over to lager. a true classic. top fermented like an ale, but fresh tasting like a lager, this is an ideal summer drink - refreshing, but also interestingly complex. the flavours are mildly spicy with just a hint of a medicinal quality - there are cloves and corriander present, and then some light fruits which range from mildly sharp such as apple, to smoothly sweet such as banana.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"brought directly from germany 0.5l bottle poured into my paulaner glass cloudy amber body, a pretty solid and typical hefeweizen colour to it. the head is soapy and frothy at first, but then it becomes a little bit disappointing. not very great head retention minimal lacing. nothing spectacular, as far as aroma goes, but it s in line with the majority of good wheat beers. yeast, bread, a touch of toffee, some citrus notes and some spices . tastes like a typical german wheat beer, only milder. wheaty breadiness and moderate banana-like sweetness dominate the palate. some hints of spice and vanilla add another layer of flavour. a bit too tart in the finish, which i found quite surprising. light-to-medium body to it. definitely not watery, which i really liked. medium level of carbonation. some moderate spiciness on the tongue. quite soft overall. a slight hint of alcohol could be detected. even though this is a 5.3 beer, i felt that it was a bit hefty, and i even managed to get a minor buzz after having eaten a full dinner. odd. overall, it was nice to try a non-bavarian german wheat beer for a change, and i would definitely be willing to try it again. however, i would probably not put it in my top-5 hefeweizen list.",Positive,Positive,Positive

"for me this beer represents home, purely emotional since i live about 10 k s from the brewery. this is a decent beer for a decent price, something you can drink every day. it ll give you no headaches, no stomach problems due to an excess of carbonic acid and has a proper taste to alcohol ratio. it s definitely a pilsener but isn t as light as the well known lagers as heineken fosters carlsberg stella. very drinkable at room temperature.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"bottled, 500ml from an ocado delivery, hatfield, herts. hazed gold with white head. took my time and dug out a weisse beer glass, which seemed to make a difference. this is more restrained on the wheat front, in fact it s a little on the watery side. there are indistinct, banana, pear drop, herby notes in there along with a sweet wheaty bready note. it s okay.",Negative,Positive,Negative

"ok,it s highly hyped and was created for export rather recently in the history of the brewery. poured from a 14.9 oz. can with the nitrogen widget in to a spaten glass. color is opaque black. head is off white and long lasting with much sheet lacing also long lasting. nose is roasted malt. taste is slighty bitter with a characteristic but slightly roasted maltiness. with the nitro widget, the carbonation is extremely fine with the head remaining to the last, which i like. the palate is a milky smoothness that could lead one to drinking far more of this beverage than one may wish. while it is not the best stout in the world, it is the most famous and for good reason because it is eminently quaffable and maintains the rudiments of a stout. interestingly, it states it is pasteurized, more brews should. enjoy!",Positive,Positive,Positive

"thanks strykzone for this superb beer. from a 12 oz bottle this poured inky black with a fat tan head that lasted a very long time and left very thick lacking rings. the nose is very rich with roasted malts giving aromas of chocolate, rip fruits and coffee. lots of coffee. about as smooth and rich a mouthfeel as you can imagine, flavors are dominated by the coffee, but there is still good balance leading up to a long dry bitter finish. fantastic stuff.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"deep, dark brown body with a light tan head. mouth-watering and complex aroma of espresso beans, roast, some burnt phenolics, chocolate, and spice. flavor is like an intense, robust cup of the best coffee you could ever have. has a lot more dimensions than most coffee beers. lingers for a long and enjoyable eternity. perfect fullness and texture. i like this better than alesmith speedway stout. this is a great experience and has to be the world s best beer with a twist-off cap. thanks for sharing, eric!",Positive,Positive,Positive
